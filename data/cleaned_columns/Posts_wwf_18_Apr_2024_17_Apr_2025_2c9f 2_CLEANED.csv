Today four billion people experience severe water scarcity for at least one month every year. And half of the world s corals have already been lost.This is because nature is in crisis.  Right now it s being destroyed at a rate unprecedented in human history.We must act now to protect people and nature   and work together to overcome one of the greatest challenges of our time. We need to reverse nature loss ending the decade with more nature than we started with not less.  Leaders: The time to act is NOW.

What does chilli have to do with elephants?  For Mathews Chilambe and Chamunolwa Jimayi the answer is a creative solution to reduce human-elephant conflict in South Dambwa Zambia.As members of the Conservation and Tourism Society (CATS) Mathews and Chamunolwa have turned chili into a powerful tool for both conservation and community support.Through an innovative outgrower scheme CATS purchases locally grown chilli providing farmers with a steady income and a reliable market. The chili is then transformed into chilli bricks    natural deterrents that help keep elephants away from crops and villages.Their approach is all about bringing people and wildlife together ensuring a peaceful coexistence. #NaturesHeroes like Mathews and Chamunolwa are leading the way toward a future where people live in harmony with nature. wereldnatuurfonds,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/01/wwf_18090331642533849.jpeg,0.23595,2025-01-15 10:00:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_wwf_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2c9f 2_CLEANED_43.jpeg

Nature unites us.  Forests provide us with food clean water and protection against natural hazards like floods.  One community in Oaxaca Mexico is uniting to restore and sustainably manage their forest and watershed - for the benefit of communities all the way along their river. Restoring the forest restores the river flow. We depend on water from this region. If our river collapses we will all collapse. The community s relationship with nature is shaped by Zapotec culture and traditions which empowers them to create sustainable livelihoods. We are different but we are united. Water unites us.  #RestorationWorks,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/06/wwf_18026403904950644.jpeg,0.08463,2024-06-10 17:08:00,reel,Posts_wwf_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2c9f 2_CLEANED_123.jpeg
