REMINDER: There is NO safe way to transport oil and gas.When oil companies drill they spill.Yesterday a monumental collision between a cargo ship and an oil tanker occurred in the North Sea—bad news for the sea wildlife and air around it. What we don’t yet know is just how bad it will be.Fossil fuel explosions collisions leaks and fires are poisoning our air land and seas. It’s impossible to fully clean up an oil spill and ecosystems never completely recover.While greedy corporations and billionaire CEOs line their pockets they endanger workers push up household costs and destroy the ecosystems life depends on.It’s time to hold them to account and make them pay for the damage they’ve done.Take action via the link in our bio @‌greenpeace#StopDrillingStartPaying #shipcollision #stenaimmaculate #solong #northsea #fuelspill #oilspills #climatecrisis #biodiversitycrisis #marinelife #pollution,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/03/greenpeace_18485783563024581.jpeg,1.8955,2025-03-11 01:04 PM,CAROUSEL_ALBUM

Shocking. A recent report reveals global wildlife populations have shrunk by an average of 73% in the past 50 years.⁣⁣Global biodiversity is collapsing - but its not just a threat to wildlife - its a fundamental threat to HUMANITY.⁣⁣⁣A major reason for wildlife loss is habitat destruction and problematic land use by humans. An astronomical amount of land is dedicated to cows (and feeding cows) which feed a small population with big appetites. Huge swaths of suburban and rural land are dedicated to grass lawns that provide nothing to the ecosystem and require toxic chemicals to maintain. All that land was once habitat.⁣⁣⁣Biodiversity is essential to life on earth. We must change the way we use our land in order to bring wildlife back from the brink.⁣⁣⁣We need to make a massive switch to more plant-based diets wherever possible plant native and support habitat restoration!⁣⁣⁣The UN Biodiversity #COP16 currently taking place in Cali Colombia is a critical opportunity to change course on a more global scale and make the radical systemic changes that our planet desperately needs.⁣⁣Tap the link in our Instagram bio to read more and take action⁠⁣⁣⁣#biodiversity #biodiversitycrisis #climatecrisis #ecosystems #COP16Colombia #COP16 ⁣#greenpeace #wildlife #plantbased #vegetarian #vegan #lessmeatlessheat,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/10/greenpeace_17946564425767505.jpeg,0.87962,2024-10-24 01:07 PM,CAROUSEL_ALBUM
“Nothing is as powerful as an idea whose time has come.”🎉 The US State of Vermont has passed a groundbreaking ‘Make Polluters Pay’ law.This new law gives the state the power to make big oil pay their fair share for the climate damages they have caused.The 2023 floods alone cost Vermonters over US$ 1 billion. Many are still recovering.🏚️ Without this new Climate Superfund the costs of climate-fuelled extreme weather falls on everyday people.Vermont isn’t alone. 👷 California the fifth largest economy in the world is working on a similar bill. Along with states like New York Massachusetts and Maryland.Vermont’s new law is a HUGE step towards holding polluters accountable and easing the financial burden on communities. Vermont’s climate superfund is a bold move for climate justice that sets a clear precedent for the rest of the world.An additional tax on fossil fuel majors based in the OECD countries could raise $720 billion for loss and damage by the end of the decade.

How on Earth is it normal that billionaires grow richer every second while millions struggle to afford food housing and survive climate disasters?Inequality is out of control because our system rewards wealth with more wealth. The rich get richer while the rest are left behind.

But the truth? The system is rigged to keep power where it is.It’s time to disrupt this cycle. Taxing the super-rich isn’t radical—it’s necessary.

Greenpeace statement on the ongoing war in #GazaGreenpeace urges that both the Israeli government and Hamas unequivocally agree to support and abide by the UN Security Council Ceasefire resolution (2735) in full. To declare an immediate and permanent #CeasefireNow. We call for the bullets and bombs to be silenced so that the growing voices for peace can be heard.Over 250 days have passed since the horrific events of October 7th saw more than 1200 Israelis killed in a single day at the hands of Hamas. Around 250 people were taken hostage. 120 hostages remain in Gaza.Since that day the horror has been compounded many times over. 37000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces. The majority of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been forced to flee their homes. Much of Gaza has been reduced to rubble famine and disease are rife nowhere and no one is safe. Sanity and humanity must be restored in the face of this unfolding genocide.Since the outset Greenpeace has supported calls for an immediate and permanent ceasefire. We call on Hamas to immediately release all hostages. We call for the Israeli Government to immediately end the blockades on the supply of food water medicine and fuel to the people of Gaza and release all illegally detained civilians.Swipe left on the post to read the rest of our statement.,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/06/greenpeace_18022479983467804.jpeg,0.41175,2024-06-18 12:50 PM,CAROUSEL_ALBUM

“If you are appalled by the violence imposed on one man and not the violence imposed on millions something isn’t right!”— Claudia De la Cruz activistIt’s time to name the 🐘​ in the room: Structural Violence IS violence.🚩​ Denying healthcare is violence.🚩​ Evictions are violence.🚩​ Polluting our air water & food is violence.🚩​ Extreme wealth inequality is violence.Yet within this system structural violence is ignored—because to truly take it seriously would mean acknowledging that our current economic model is built on it.The ultra-rich hoard wealth while billions struggle. Their luxury lifestyles fuel emissions that push the planet closer to collapse. And this system? It has self-reinforcing loops that keep it running—unless we break them.Disrupting inequality is key to stopping this deadly cycle of social and environmental destruction.Say it and say it often: Structural violence is violence.

Big oil has known about the harmful effects of fossil fuels on climate change since at least the 1970s but chose to spend billions of US dollars spreading misinformation. This strategy including funding think tanks to cast doubt on climate science has delayed global efforts to combat global warming.Equinor was reportedly fined NOK 50 million in 2005 for price manipulation in Sweden. Total was fined EUR 500000 in France in 2018 for paying bribes to secure a major gas contract in Iran in 1997.BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 spilled millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico causing extensive damage to livelihoods marine life and habitats. In 2004 BP promoted the term ‘carbon footprint’ to shift blame for global heating onto individuals deflecting attention from big oil corporations.In the 1960s Texaco (now Chevron) dumped billions of gallons of toxic wastewater into rivers polluting groundwater and farmland. According to Amazonwatch Chevron disregarded environmental regulations earning an extra US$5 billion over 20 years. In 2016 Indigenous communities and farmers won a court judgement against Chevron but the company refused to pay.Since Shell arrived in 1958 Nigeria’s Ogoniland once fertile suffered from toxic spills. Ken Saro-Wiwa led peaceful resistance against Shell protesting its exploitation of Ogoniland. Under Saro-Wiwa’s leadership locals challenged Shell and Nigeria’s military regime leading to violent crackdowns. Ken Saro-Wiwa and 8 colleagues were wrongfully convicted and executed by the Nigerian government on November 10 1995.Big oil’s contribution to climate change has worsened extreme weather disasters causing significant financial and social costs for affected communities. The recovery burden falls on those least able to handle such crises. It’s time we ask: Who pays?How would you rate the legacy of big oil corporations?

Here are some facts about the Climate Justice Delivery Service:⁣⁣🌪️ The service was established in 2024 to deliver debris from extreme weather events to the doorsteps of oil corporations. ⁣⁣🏚️ Destroyed items donated by survivors of extreme weather events such as floods wildfires and storms are collected and sent to big oil and gas corporations to highlight how their operations are destroying lives and communities.⁣⁣Extreme weather events including typhoons and floods are becoming more frequent and more severe  due to climate change caused by the burning of oil and gas. Homes are destroyed lives are claimed and people are forced to move.⁣⁣🧸 Debris including items like damaged children’s toys and furniture have been gathered with extreme weather survivors in countries like Brazil the Philippines and South Africa. The collected debris presents the damage caused by global warming.⁣⁣💀 Fossil fuels drilled by major oil companies such as Shell BP and Exxon are releasing greenhouse gases that heat the planet. To keep global warming below 1.5°C the use of oil and gas must be stopped. This includes halting all new fossil fuel projects and transitioning to renewable energy like wind and solar.⁣⁣A demand is being made by Greenpeace for oil and gas companies to stop drilling switch to clean energy and take responsibility by paying for the damage caused by global warming. The goal is to protect the planet for future generations.⁣⁣As more and more people are standing against Big Oil the industry gets desperate. It is now trying to use lawsuits to continue with its toxic business as usual. Corporations like Shell ENI TotalEnergies and energytransferlp have taken Greenpeace organisations to court. Using lawsuits against activists organisations and indigenous leaders Big Oil is trying to silence those standing to protect the earth. ⁣⁣Big Oils desperation shows we’re making an impact.

Commemorating the 79th anniversary of Indonesias independence on 17 August 2024 GreenpeaceID activists unfurled a giant red banner Indonesia is not for sale Merdeka! (Freedom) close to Indonesias new capital city Nusantara (IKN) in East Kalimantan.This action was a part of activities held together with numerous civil society organisations and local residents who are voicing various concerns about environmental damage caused by the IKN development also about the weakening of democracy in the country.IKN is a microcosm of what’s impacted the island of Kalimantan (Borneo) over past decades. Indonesian government collusion with pulpwood and palm oil oligarchs has been the main driver for the loss of 15 million hectares of forest. At least 150000 orangutans have been lost.The IKN that he (Indonesian president Joko Widodo) is proud of is in fact a haphazard and reckless project that takes away the rights of indigenous and local communities.

And it is far from over.⁣⁣Being SLAPPed with a liability of more than US$660 million for something we so clearly did not do is not for the faint of heart. But we are not faint of heart. Greenpeace has never been a movement that shies away from big fights.⁣⁣They thought they could break us. They thought they could intimidate us into silence. They were wrong. They blew wind into our sails and we grew bigger and stronger than ever before.⁣⁣We will not back down. ⁣We will not be silenced.⁣⁣Check the link in our bio for the full message from Greenpeace International Executive Director Mads Christensen 💚🌎,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/03/greenpeace_18044327996592625.jpeg,0.1683,2025-03-24 08:01 PM,IMAGE

Drill baby drill.Trump’s decision defies both science and diplomacy. This is a political gamble and we will all bear the consequences in a world where every tenth of a degree of global warming matters.Some states and cities will continue to pursue their own greenhouse gas reduction goals. Similarly the rest of the world will not wait for the United States to act on the climate crisis.Over the past decade the Paris Agreement has proven its resilience. Its targets remain central to the COP30 negotiations set to take place in Brazil this November.The fight continues.#climatecrisis #climatechange #extremeweather #parisagreement #trump #US #cop30 #cop30belém,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/01/greenpeace_17961199649849802.jpeg,0.16305,2025-01-28 04:03 PM,IMAGE

Important reminder: people power is real and hope is created through action. As climate scientists say there’s no “it’s too late i’s over” for anthropogenic climate change.

I’m in your food and inside your body. I’m in the ocean inside fish and in the air you breathe. What am I? That’s right — plastic.Plastic pollution is everywhere damaging the health of humans animals and the natural world. It pollutes the air and fuels the climate crisis. Globally only 9% of plastic gets recycled and if nothing is done plastic production is projected to triple by the year 2050! But right now we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to tackle the crisis on a global scale — a Global Plastics Treaty that drastically cuts plastic production!Throughout July waterbearnetwork is backing Greenpeace to call for a strong and ambitious #PlasticsTreaty before the critical fifth and last round of UN talks pick back up in Busan Korea!Tap the link in our Instagram bio (Greenpeace) to join us in demanding world leaders deliver a strong Global Plastics Treaty that will cut plastic production!

Two years ago world leaders made history by agreeing on the Global Ocean Treaty. Through this game-changing tool governments can create ocean sanctuaries off-limits to destructive industries plundering the ocean for profit. But a treaty on paper means nothing without real action.The UN Ocean Conference is only 100 days away and to make the Treaty work at sea 60 governments must turn it into national law. Right now only 18 have stepped up. Scientists warn that we must protect 30% of the ocean by 2030 for marine life to recover. The clock is ticking. Governments CAN still meet this goal but only if they act now.📢 Add your voice!

Eni one of the world’s biggest polluters just announced €5.3BILLION in profits for 2024 — Earth’s hottest year on record.⁣⁣While Eni makes these obscene profits their business - the extraction and combustion of fossil fuels - is driving deadly extreme weather and damage to people’s homelands and livelihoods.⁣⁣⁣The hundreds of billions they rake in have been taken from the pockets of individuals and families pushing basic necessities out of reach for many - either directly through skyrocketing energy bills that have been exacerbating the cost of living or indirectly with industry tax breaks and subsidies.⁣⁣⁣Individuals families and small businesses should not have to bear rising energy costs or go without basic needs while oil and gas companies laugh all the way to the bank.⁣⁣⁣Their emissions poison our atmosphere while their waste contaminates the water we drink and the air we breathe. Treating our communities and planet as collateral damage these corporations ignore the consequences of extreme weather while homes are destroyed and livelihoods wiped out.⁣⁣⁣The fossil fuel industry has been aware of this crisis they caused for decades but have hidden the truth and discredited the scientific evidence. The economic cost solely from weather and climate events in 2023 was an estimated $ 301 billion USD* paid by the taxpayer.⁣⁣It’s time for justice: governments must make these companies stop drilling for polluting fuels and start paying for the damage they’ve caused and the just and fair transition we need.⁣⁣Tag @‌eni in the comments and demand they stop drilling and start paying!⁣.⁣.⁣.⁣📸 Claudio Descalzi CEO of Eni in a retouched image (top).⁣⁣Woman near her house after floods in Migori and Homa Bay Counties in Kenya in 2020 (below).⁣⁣*According to insurers Gallagher Re⁣⁣Images of CEOs used in this campaign are staged and doctored for illustrative purposes.

We’re celebrating World Oceans Day with actress model and TV presenter amandadupont who recently met coastal communities in Senegal to support them in their fight for survival. Deeply touched by the encounter Amanda said: “These communities have a special relationship with the ocean because fishing has been in their families for centuries the ocean is in their blood. However the industrial fishing industry is robbing them of their livelihoods and destroying their way of life and they’ve had enough!

🇲🇭The flag of the Republic of the Marshall Islands flies at half-mast aboard the Rainbow Warrior in remembrance of the devastating Castle Bravo nuclear test. ⁣.⁣🌅71 years ago the U.S. detonated a nuclear bomb 1000x more powerful than Hiroshima. The explosion lit up the sky like a second sunrise—what Marshallese people call the Day of Two Suns.

A world without emperor penguins 🐧🐧 is just too sad to imagine 😭😭 but a brand-new report highlights this shocking possibility. ⁣.⁣When penguin chicks hatch they’re not able to swim as they don’t have their waterproof feathers yet but climate change is causing the sea ice to melt earlier in the year which causes the tiny chicks to drown if the ice gives way beneath them 😲😲⁣.⁣The ocean provides a buffer against impacts from the climate crisis but that comes at a huge cost to the ocean itself causing its health to drastically decline.⁣.⁣So will we safeguard the oceans by drastically reducing our emissions and urging governments to create ocean sanctuaries to protect at least 30% of the oceans by 2030?

🚨 BREAKING 🚨⁣⁣After a historic win earlier this year GreenpeaceNorge and NaturogUngdom are facing the Norwegian government in Court again in an effort to immediately halt the ongoing development of three illegal oil fields.⁣⁣In January an Oslo District Court ruling invalidated the previous approvals of these projects for lack of impact assessments of global climate effects. They also issued orders restraining any new permits for the fields ⁣⁣Since then the Norwegian state has appealed the decisions and ignored the injunctions.⁣⁣Taking ambitious action to address the climate emergency is a duty of states and not some favour to communities.

A dozen South Sumatran residents attended Palembang District Court this morning to register a lawsuit against three plantation companies over the chronic smoke haze that has blighted their lives due to fires repeatedly burning on peatland inside the companies’ concession areas. The three companies named in the lawsuit are PT Bumi Mekar Hijau (BMH) PT Bumi Andalas Permai (BAP) and PT Sebangun Bumi Andalas Wood Industries (SBA Wood Industries).⁣⁣“The drainage and destruction of peatlands in these areas which subsequently leads to out-of-control forest fires and haze severely exacerbates the climate crisis. The increase in carbon emissions due to forest fires and haze also undermines emissions reduction efforts jeopardizing the achievement of Indonesia’s climate targets” said greenpeaceID Forest Campaigner Belgis Habiba.⁣⁣Supported by a coalition of civil society and environmental organisations called the South Sumatra Smoke Suit Initiative (Inisiasi Sumatera Selatan Penggugat Asap – ISSPA) the twelve residents are asking the court to award compensation for the deprivation of their right to a healthy environment and for environmental restoration after the fires which have harmed them both materially and immaterially.⁣⁣#RightToCleanAir #ActOnClimate #AirPollution #ClimateCrisis,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/09/greenpeace_18095566993413001.jpeg,0.0631,2024-09-08 08:23 AM,reel

📢📢NEWS WORTH CELEBRATING🥳🥳⁣The EU Parliament just voted to ratify the Global Ocean Treaty 🎉 🎉 ⁣With a significant majority of 556 to 36 the EU vote could inspire others to ratify. ⁣At present only four countries have ratified the Treaty – Palau Chile Belize and Seychelles. Its now up to the 27 EU member states to follow in their footsteps and urgently ratify the Treaty before the next UN Ocean Conference in June 2025. This will enable governments to cover the ocean in a network of sanctuaries and to protect at least 30% of the global ocean by 2030. ⁣.⁣.⁣.⁣#ProtectTheOceans⁣,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/04/greenpeace_18010025882375698.jpeg,0.05712,2024-04-24 01:38 PM,IMAGE

Greenpeace activists in more than 15 cities around the world are expressing solidarity against the abusive legal tactics of US-based fossil fuel company Energy TransferLP (ET) during two sustained global weeks of action. Greenpeace International (GPI) and the Greenpeace entities in the US are currently defending against a meritless US$ 300 million lawsuit from ET related to the Indigenous-led protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016.

Trigger Warning: Graphic Animal Content ⚠️🔥 “Every rescue is 50/50 so I have a 50% chance of failure” 🔥Paula’s reality is unfortunately one of many. Her daily fight to save wild animals in Brazil’s burning Pantanal is shaped by a combination between climate change and criminal fires often initiated by the agriculture sector.The agricultural sector along with banks and investors remains largely unaccountable for the severe environmental and social impacts of their actions. Despite the immense harm caused including loss of biodiversity and increased greenhouse gas emissions there is insufficient scrutiny on how hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and investments contribute to the destruction of natural ecosystems.According to a recent MapBiomas Águas survey the Pantanal’s water surface has shrunk by 61% since 1985. In 2020 fires tragically claimed the lives of 17 million animals including 1.5 million birds and 458000 primates as reported in the 2021 study “Wildfire in the Pantanal: Impacts and Management Challenges”.As we approach the UN Biodiversity COP16 in Cali Colombia let’s raise our voices.

The concept of Mind Bombs centers on using powerful stories to change the world rather than actual bombs. It was first coined by Bob Hunter during the 1970s Anti-Whaling Campaign where Greenpeace activists set out to photograph the damages caused by commercial whaling in the North Pacific. These photos by Rex Weyler showed the world the devastating deaths of numerous whales done for the sake of profit. This non-violent action greatly influenced the International Whaling Committee to put a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1982 and a total ban in 1985.Source: BBC#whales #ClimateAction #oceans #photography,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/10/greenpeace_17989507913711728.jpeg,0.05338,2024-10-18 06:18 AM,CAROUSEL_ALBUM

** Don’t let Big Oil silence the climate movement.

If they win Greenpeace in the USA might have to shut its doors. ⁣⁣Energy Transfer’s meritless lawsuit is an attack on free speech and peaceful protest. It’s part of a concerted global attack by Big Oil which includes lawsuits from Big Oil corporations like ENI Shell and TotalEnergies. ⁣⁣But Big Oil doesn’t realise the strength of the climate movement.

Yes the emissions from meat and dairy giants rival those of fossil fuel companies.⁣⁣A Greenpeace Nordic report released a few months ago revealed that JBS the worlds largest meat producer would rank 5th if put on a list alongside the reportedly biggest methane emitting corporations and rivals the methane emissions reported for major oil companies ExxonMobil and Shell combined.⁣⁣We urgently need to put an end to the overproduction and overconsumption of industrial meat and dairy. We must reject ever-larger factory farms—cruel polluting and destructive—and push for a massive shift towards more plant-based diets wherever possible. We must also expose and reject the misleading marketing tactics of the industry which does everything it can to slow the decline in meat and dairy consumption and delay this vital transition.⁣⁣A few months ago Greenpeace activists from several countries took action outside the headquarters of major companies in the sector. They were there to remind us that we can and must meaningfully slow climate breakdown within our lifetime by transitioning to a just food system—one that moves away from industrial meat and dairy production and promotes plant-based alternatives and call on governments to act urgently to support this transition.⁣⁣📸 © IATP / Bryce Groves / Jana Eriksson / Michael Hedelain / Greenpeace⁣⁣⁣#climatecrisis #meatanddairy #lessmeatlessheat #stopfactoryfarming #plantbased,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/02/greenpeace_18046432421208424.jpeg,0.0504,2025-02-10 01:57 PM,CAROUSEL_ALBUM

Climate crisis is a BURNING issue - literally.Right now G20 leaders are meeting in South Africa to find solutions to global economic and financial issues. But they must face reality: the climate crisis and skyrocketing inequality are twin emergencies demanding urgent action.Taxing the ultra-rich is not just an option—it’s a necessity. The revenue must be used to fight poverty protect the most vulnerable and communities hit hardest by climate disasters and fund a just transition.Global tax rules are still controlled by a small clique of wealthy countries allowing billionaires and corporations to shift profits and dodge taxes. For too long this system has let the super-rich hoard wealth while those most affected by the climate and social crises pay the price. It’s a moral outrage.Greenpeace and many others are fighting to make taxing the super-rich a global reality. Join the movement!

Did you know that most protected areas aren’t actually protected at all?😱⁣.⁣Our new report From Commitment to Action: Achieving the 30X30 Target Through the Global Ocean Treaty shows only 0.9% of the global oceans are completely off limits to destructive human activities.⁣.⁣This means many precious marine ecosystems remain vulnerable to highly damaging fishing practices like bottom trawling and longlining 🤯⁣.⁣The Global Ocean Treaty gives governments the power to create a network of global ocean sanctuaries that will help marine life recover and thrive - but it can only come to life at sea once at least 60 governments have ratified it. ⁣.⁣If governments are serious about protecting at least 30% of the oceans by 2030 they MUST ratify the Treaty NOW. ⁣Go to our LINK 🔗 IN BIO to sign the petition!⁣.⁣#ProtectTheOceans,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/10/greenpeace_18021846662251148.jpeg,0.04082,2024-10-21 06:00 PM,IMAGE

Global ocean management is broken. Since fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) first appeared 70 years ago they’ve repeatedly failed to protect the oceans. A new report from Greenpeace details how RFMOs have failed to meet their mandate for sustainably managing the impacts of fishing activity on biodiversity in international waters. ⁣.⁣The Global Ocean Treaty can deliver protection for all life in the global oceans. That’s why governments must step up and put their words into action. They must urgently ratify the Treaty and create global ocean sanctuaries.⁣⁣Go to the link in our bio to add your name to the petition and #ProtectTheOceans!,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/06/greenpeace_18124023130324363.jpeg,0.03458,2024-06-06 08:26 PM,CAROUSEL_ALBUM

Day 2 at the Fight for Alternatives Global Assembly in Manila: Youth Day! Youth activists from around the world are coming together to share workshop and brainstorm ideas for building a safe and just future with wellbeing at the core. We wanted to share some memorable quotes from Day 2’s speakers. 🇵🇭✊🌏1. Erick National Front for 40 Hours Mexico 🇲🇽“We need to be the owners of our present and our future and this is not only for the young people but for all the generations. We need to overcome taboos and prejudices. We need to raise awareness and empower our youth. The young people need to be aware of our society. The young people need to act. Rural areas are being marginalised opportunities are being taken away from the youth. We need to articulate the youth’s struggle more. We understand that this would take years of action and we need older people to help us. We need to ensure a future for us all.”2. Daisy from HAWI - Gender Equality and Inclusion Kenya 🇰🇪“For the youth we should conduct civic education. Educate them and let them know how to conduct advocacy practices on the issues that they have like unemployment and to hold politicians accountable. Guide them on which areas to go to which areas to learn from.”3. Sajida president of Sindhi Girls Student Tahreek Pakistan 🇵🇰“We have to empower the marginalised youth. We need to mobilise them unite them educate them about what is happening to us what are the actual problems and how can we overcome them. Without uniting and empowering them we cannot get any proper solutions we cannot get any progress.”,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/09/greenpeace_18021996158176842.jpeg,0.03379,2024-09-06 09:43 AM,CAROUSEL_ALBUM

The government of Porto Alegre (Brazil) didn’t budget for flood protection and now the city is facing its biggest disaster in history..What if the budget had been made by the people as it used to be?In less than a year the region of Rio Grande do Sul has faced four major floods affecting millions of people. And when we look back we see that the policies needed to prevent adapt and respond to extreme events were left out of the plans.Participatory democracy which was once a reality in #PortoAlegre and an example to the world is all about ensuring that everyone has a voice in the management of resources directing them where they really matter. It’s not just about coping with extreme events but also about defining policies that contribute to a fairer and more sustainable future so that people no longer live under a constant sense of fear and uncertainty. Change is possible and we can demand it. Join the fight for climate justice.📸: Vitor Rosa. Em menos de um ano o Rio Grande do Sul enfrentou quatro grandes enchentes afetando milhões de pessoas. E quando olhamos para trás vemos que as políticas necessárias para prevenção adaptação e resposta aos eventos extremos ficaram fora dos planos. A pergunta que ecoa é: e se as pessoas tivessem sido incluídas nas decisões do orçamento municipal? Será que a história seria diferente? A democracia participativa que já foi uma realidade em Porto Alegre e exemplo para o mundo busca exatamente isso: garantir que todos tenham espaço de voz na gestão dos recursos direcionando-os para onde realmente importa. Não é apenas sobre enfrentar eventos extremos mas também sobre definir políticas que contribuam para um futuro mais justo e sustentável que faça com que as pessoas deixem de viver sob uma sensação constante de medo e . A mudança é possível e a sociedade pode cobrar por isso.

Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (SLAPPs) are lawsuits that are filed with the intent to censor intimidate or silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a legal defence until they abandon their criticism or opposition. ⁣⁣For corporate bullies like Energy Transfer and Shell SLAPP lawsuits are about outspending opponents to intimidate them into silence. For Indigenous Peoples NGOs like Greenpeace International and class action communities fighting such SLAPP suits is about movement building in opposition to colonialist domineering and arrogant companies and their destructive projects whether in the energy sector agribusiness mining chemicals forestry etc.⁣⁣#WeWillNotBeSilenced ⁣⁣Check the link in or bio to learn more about about the global battle against SLAPPs and to share a message of solidarity 💚🌎,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/03/greenpeace_17914985103079324.jpeg,0.0282,2025-03-09 11:21 PM,CAROUSEL_ALBUM
