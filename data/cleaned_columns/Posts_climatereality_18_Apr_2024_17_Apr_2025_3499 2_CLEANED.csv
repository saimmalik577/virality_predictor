Huge climate win alert  ! As one of his final #actonclimate efforts President Biden is protecting more than 670 million acres of US lands and waters from oil and gas development. He issued two presidential memoranda to protect the US Outer Continental Shelf off the East and West Coasts the eastern Gulf of Mexico and parts of Alaskas northern Bering Sea from future oil and gas leasing.

Spot the difference? The presidents executive order to prop up the coal industry will mean more climate pollution   and higher electricity bills.

Burning fossil fuels has given us a world where climate change is makingextreme weather even more destructive all across the planet with multiple disasters striking in May alone.It s time to stop subsidizing the fossil fuels driving this destruction and invest in a fast and fair energy transition for the planet. Starting with a bold finance agreement at #COP29 in November.

Russell Vought co-author of the Heritage Foundation s #Project2025 is now one step closer to being confirmed as the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget by the Senate. Were already witnessing the alarming consequences of Project 2025 s implementation   like the attempted federal funding freeze that s already putting people out of work and threatening our climate progress.

NOAA has spent 55 years protecting lives from climate disasters providing real-time weather forecasts and advancing critical climate research. Now it s being dismantled not for the public good but for profit. We refuse to stay silent. Climate Reality staff joined 12 members of Congress including two senators outside the Department of Commerce to demand transparency accountability and an end to this reckless privatization scheme. Despite the snowy weather climate advocates union workers and scientists stood together to fight back. This isn t about efficiency. It s about shielding polluters silencing science and putting our communities at risk. We know the reality and we won t back down.,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/02/climatereality_18079938598628630.jpeg,0.44855,2025-02-18 17:00:00,IMAGE,Posts_climatereality_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_3499 2_CLEANED_15.jpeg

As our founder and chairman AlGore said yesterday: For climate advocates across the country the outcome of this election means that all of us must find ways to redouble our efforts and find bipartisan solutions to the climate crisis that create jobs promote prosperity and safeguard the future of humanity.In a moment such as this it is important to remember that all major reform efforts from civil rights to the climate movement suffer dark days. And this is surely one. We can mourn a loss but we can t linger in despair. Our planet doesn t have time for that. Now more than ever this movement needs engagement and leadership from all corners of the country.During a down moment in the struggle for civil rights Martin Luther King Jr. said something about overcoming days like this:  If you can t fly run if you can t run walk if you can t walk crawl but by all means keep moving. We know the line to solutions is never straight or easy. But we have won major victories in tackling the climate crisis and reducing climate pollution in our country and we will again.My greatest source of hope comes from the courage and commitment of grassroots leaders and advocates in the U.S. and around the world who are relentlessly pushing for progress.

Our hearts go out to everyone affected by the devastating #LAWildfires the families first responders and entire communities facing unimaginable loss. These fires which have destroyed homes businesses and lives are a glaring reminder of why we must #ActOnClimate.

As #COP29 nears remember the vital role these negotiations will play for global communities. The costs of climate change disproportionately hit those in warmer climates particularly countries in the Global South.

As students across the United States started the new school year last week a heat dome swept the country. Heat domes occur when the atmosphere traps warm air close to Earth s surface. Higher concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are causing heat domes to occur more frequently. Climate change-induced school delays and cancelations in the first month of school cannot be the new normal. The Green Schools Campaign is fighting to transition our schools to 100% clean energy to: 1. Mitigate climate change and reduce the number of days students have to endure climate disasters during the school year. 2. Build resilient schools safe to learn in during climate disasters.

We ve unfortunately done it folks. Scientists have reported that 2024 is officially the first calendar year the world s average global temperature exceeded the 1.5 C of warming threshold. 61% of the globe s land areas experienced a higher-than-average number of days with  strong heat stress  the sea was unusually warm including in ocean basins outside of the Pacific s El Ni o region and water vapor in our atmosphere reached its highest level in over 33 years. These impacts have a direct link to human-induced global warming. But all hope is not lost we still have time to prevent this temporary crisis from becoming a permanent reality. Our world leaders cannot ignore this reality any longer. We need to accelerate climate action NOW while we still have time to do something about it.

As our founder and chairman AlGore said tonight:While the agreement reached at #COP29 avoids immediate failure it is far from a success. On the key issues like climate finance and the transition away from fossil fuels this is   yet again   the bare minimum. We cannot continue to rely on last-minute half measures. Leaders today shirk their responsibility by focusing on long-term aspirational goals that extend far beyond their own terms in office. To meet the challenge of our time we need real action at the scale of months and years not decades and quarter-centuries.This experience in Baku illuminates deeper flaws in the COP process including the outsized influence of fossil fuel interests that has hobbled this process since its inception. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been particularly obstructive. Putting the future of humanity at severe risk in order to make more money is truly disgraceful behavior. Reforming this process so that the polluters are not in effective control must be a priority.On climate finance our primary task in the coming years must be to not only fulfill and build upon the financial commitments agreed to at COP 29 but to unleash even larger flows of affordable and fair private capital for developing countries. Ultimately coming out of COP 29 we must transform disappointment into determination. We can solve the climate crisis. Whether we do so in time to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement will depend on what comes next. #onthegroundcop29,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/11/climatereality_18076553983603037.jpeg,0.26057,2024-11-24 01:03:00,IMAGE,Posts_climatereality_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_3499 2_CLEANED_37.jpeg

Funding frozen. Communities left in limbo. The $7 billion Solar for All program was set to bring clean energy and lower energy costs to low-income families in our communities. But now? epagov under the new administration just cut off access to the funds for the cities states and groups running the programs   despite contracts already being signed and consequences hurting the most vulnerable. Unfortunately grant recipients for this work woke up to find themselves locked out of the grant portal with no warning no accountability and no true point of contact. Even after a federal judge blocked the spending freeze EPA has still refused to restore access to the funds! This isn t just bureaucratic chaos   it s an intentional attack on clean energy and the communities that need it most. The money is there. The projects were ready. People were ready and invested. Now they re stalled while the administration claims it s reviewing processes. Or whatever that means. This is morally and likely legally wrong. We cannot keep failing our most vulnerable.,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/01/climatereality_17853470508328683.jpeg,0.18828,2025-01-31 01:04:00,IMAGE,Posts_climatereality_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_3499 2_CLEANED_53.jpeg
