When governments fall short leaders like Michael Bloomberg step up. 🌍 By funding the U.N. climate body (UNFCCC) after Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement Bloomberg ensures that vital climate talks and progress continue.“We deeply appreciate the generous support from Bloomberg Philanthropies and the leadership shown by Mike Bloomberg” said Simon Stiell U.N. climate chief. Last year Bloomberg Philanthropies contributed $4.5 million to the UNFCCC supporting a core budget of 240 million euros for 2024-2025. As U.S. federal action falters Bloomberg’s leadership highlights the power of private philanthropy to fill the gap and keep global climate goals alive. This isnt just about funding—its about action.

Trump’s decision to reverse the phase-out of plastic straws for paper alternatives isn’t just environmentally reckless—it’s a direct threat to human health. 🌍Plastic straws contribute to the 8 million tons of plastic waste polluting our oceans each year threatening marine life and ecosystems. But the damage doesn’t stop at wildlife—microplastics have made their way into our water food and even our bodies. A study in Nature Medicine found elevated concentrations of microplastics in human brains raising alarms about their potential link to neurological diseases. Research from the University of New Mexico Health Sciences reveals brain plastic levels have surged by 50% over the past 8 years with dementia patients showing up to 10 times the levels found in others. There’s enough plastic in our brains to form a straw. As toxicologist Matthew Campen said “These nanomaterials could interfere with brain connections and may even contribute to dementia.By promoting plastic straws Trump is ignoring science and prioritizing convenience over public health. The risks are real and this decision threatens future generations.

As the climate crisis worsens Big Oil is doubling down—spending billions to secure fossil fuel production into the 2030s. ExxonMobil and Chevron made massive acquisitions while ignoring renewable energy investment and focusing on oil and gas.Here’s the kicker: Taxpayers are footing the bill—for new oil wells and the cleanup of pollution left behind. Big Oil prioritizes profits over the planet and your future.🌡️ In 2023 Big Oil spent $113.8 billion on stock buybacks during the hottest year on record while global temperatures surpassed 1.5°C for the first time.This isn’t just a tragedy—it’s a crime. Big Oil knew but chose to ignore the warnings. Now we’re left with the consequences.Even if you don’t believe in climate change your tax dollars are funding the cleanup.🚨 Its time for change.

EARTHDAY.ORG pays tribute to the extraordinary life of President Jimmy Carter who will be laid to rest on January 9 2025. Carter’s lifelong commitment to peace and his visionary leadership on renewable energy leave a lasting impact.“His early advocacy for solar energy resonates deeply with our mission” says Kathleen Rogers President of EARTHDAY.ORG noting its alignment with the 2025 Earth Day theme Our Power Our Planet.Amid the 1970s energy crisis Carter boldly championed renewables aiming for 20% of U.S. energy from renewable sources by 2000. “If he’d had a second term our climate and prosperity would look very different today” recalls Denis Hayes Earth Day’s first organizer.We honor his vision for a cleaner future and extend condolences to his family.

BREAKING: New York Governor Kathy Hochul faces MAGA backlash after signing a historic law holding fossil fuel companies accountable for climate damages.The new legislation requires major polluters—those responsible for the majority of emissions between 2000 and 2018—to pay roughly $3 billion annually for the next 25 years to fund climate recovery efforts.State Senator Liz Krueger a lead sponsor of the bill called it a “shot heard ‘round the world.”“For years courts dismissed climate lawsuits against Big Oil saying lawmakers should decide. Now the New York State Legislature—the world’s 10th largest economy—has acted. We’ve made it clear: those most responsible for the climate crisis must help clean up the damage” Krueger said.New York now joins Vermont as the second state to enact such legislation. With New York’s influence this decision could have ripple effects far beyond the state.Local and state action matters.

Climate change isn’t some distant threat—it’s hitting home hard.  Since 2018 over 1.9M home insurance contracts have been dropped as wildfires hurricanes and other climate disasters make areas too risky for insurers.�The U.S. now faces 4x more billion-dollar disasters than 40 years ago. In 2023 alone weather-related damages exceeded $100B.📉 The Ripple Effects:•No insurance = no mortgage locking young people out of homeownership.•Dropped policies are spreading nationwide—from Florida to California and Hawaii.•Property values plummet slashing funding for schools police and essential services.💰 The Cost of Inaction:�State-run high-risk pools offer limited coverage at exorbitant premiums.

The European Commission has just banned Bisphenol A (BPA) in food contact materials like can coatings and plastic bottles. This bold step aligns with the latest scientific findings aiming to protect public health by reducing exposure to harmful chemicals. BPA disrupts the endocrine system posing significant health risks and the EU will phase it out over the next 18 months. 🔬Meanwhile the US has recently shifted its stance on the global plastics treaty. While the Biden administration initially supported limits on plastic production they’ve now backed away from mandatory caps favoring a more flexible approach with voluntary national targets. This shift has sparked concern among environmental advocates who fear it could weaken efforts to tackle plastic pollution on a global scale. 🌍The EU is leading the charge on both plastic pollution and chemical safety—its time the US follows suit and takes stronger action for both our health and the planet!

Environmental justice must be at the center of the clean energy transition. Many communities—especially those long reliant on coal oil and gas—are already burdened by pollution poor health and economic instability. Nearly 64 million people live in these areas with 45% designated as disadvantaged due to excessive pollution and limited resources.Fossil fuel facilities have left lasting health impacts from heart disease to asthma. A just transition means prioritizing these communities—not just for economic support but for the clean air and water they’ve long been denied.Take action now: Sign the renewable energy petition and join us for Earth Day 2025 to fight for a cleaner more equitable future.#blackhistorymonth #advocacy #diversity #environmentalhealth #health #toxic,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/02/earthdaynetwork_18285179032220380.jpeg,0.13908,2025-02-03 10:21 PM,CAROUSEL_ALBUM

Did you know that producing just one liter of bottled water in the U.S. consumes more than half a liter of oil? 🛢️💧In 2006 producing plastic for bottled water in the U.S. consumed approximately 17 million barrels of oil—enough energy to fuel over 1 million cars for a year. 🚗💨 (Source: Pacific Institute)Since then the bottled water industry has grown significantly. From 2010 to 2020 market consumption increased by 73% with consumption projected to rise from 350 billion liters in 2021 to 460 billion liters by 2025. With this increase energy consumption for bottled water production has likely surged as well.The real cost of convenience is higher than you think.

The Clean Energy Revolution Is Here—And It’s Moving FastFor decades the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington State was one of the most contaminated sites in the U.S. a relic of the nation’s nuclear weapons program. Now it’s set to become the country’s largest solar farm—a powerful symbol of how the clean energy transition is not just possible but already happening.With 3.45 million solar panels planned this massive project will generate up to 2000 megawatts of electricity—enough to power Seattle San Francisco and Denver combined. It will also include large-scale battery storage doubling its impact and making it a key player in the shift toward a reliable renewable energy grid.The best part? This isn’t just about energy—it’s about jobs innovation and economic opportunity. The project will create thousands of jobs attract clean tech investments and prove that repurposing land for renewables is a scalable forward-thinking solution.While political uncertainty looms over clean energy policy the reality is clear: Renewables have already left the station. The demand for clean power is skyrocketing driven by technological advancements and public pressure for a sustainable future. Major companies entire cities and even historically contaminated sites are embracing the shift—because the future is renewable and it’s happening now.The world is at a tipping point. This Earth Day let’s harness Our Power Our Planet and push even harder for a clean energy future.Earth day 2025 link in our bio 🔗 #OurPowerOurPlanet #RenewableEnergyNow #EarthActionDay #EarthDay2025 #EarthDay55 #positivenews #solar #renewables,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/03/earthdaynetwork_18006851660726016.jpeg,0.11722,2025-03-21 03:19 PM,CAROUSEL_ALBUM
