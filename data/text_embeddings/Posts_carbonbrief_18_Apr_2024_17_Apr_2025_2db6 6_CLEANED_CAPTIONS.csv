As the first chart shows for the first time ever the combined output from solar and wind surpassed coal in the US electricity mix.  Transport remained the highest-emitting sector in the US with a 0.8% increase in emissions driven by post-pandemic rebounds in jet fuel and petrol consumption (see the second chart) However despite coal-power hitting a 60-year low greenhouse gas emissions barely budged in 2024   falling just 0.2%.Currently the US  is not on track to meet either its 2030 Paris Agreement target of a 50-52% reduction in emissions relative to 2005 levels or its newly set 2035 goal of a 61-66% reduction.As the third chart shows to bridge the gap between the current US trajectory and its stated goals would require an average emissions reduction of 7.6% every year from 2025 through to 2030. This would be more than two-thirds of the drop seen as a result of Covid lockdowns in 2020.Click the link in our bio for more on the Rhodium analysis.#USEmissions #ParisAgrement #Emissions #Decarbonisation,in 2024 coalpower output in the us fell to its lowest level in 50 years according to new analysis by the rhodium group as the first chart shows for the first time ever the combined output from solar and wind surpassed coal in the us electricity mix transport remained the highestemitting sector in the us with a 08 increase in emissions driven by postpandemic rebounds in jet fuel and petrol consumption see the second chart however despite coalpower hitting a 60year low greenhouse gas emissions barely budged in 2024 falling just 02currently the us is not on track to meet either its 2030 paris agreement target of a 5052 reduction in emissions relative to 2005 levels or its newly set 2035 goal of a 6166 reductionas the third chart shows to bridge the gap between the current us trajectory and its stated goals would require an average emissions reduction of 76 every year from 2025 through to 2030 this would be more than twothirds of the drop seen as a result of covid lockdowns in 2020click the link in our bio for more on the rhodium analysis#usemissions #parisagrement #emissions #decarbonisation

The analysis uses both the latest global surface temperature data and climate model simulations.  Click the link in our bio to read the full analysis.  Global temperatures in 2023 blew past expectations to set the warmest year on record even topping 1.5C in one of the main datasets.This warmth has continued into 2024 meaning that this year is also on track to potentially pass 1.5C in one or more datasets.  However crossing 1.5C in one or even two years is not the same as exceeding the 1.5C limit under the Paris Agreement.  The goal is generally considered to refer to long-term warming rather than annual temperatures that include the short-term influence of natural fluctuations in the climate such as El Ni o.  Nonetheless recent warming has led to renewed debate around whether the world might imminently pass the 1.5C Paris Agreement limit   sooner than climate scientists and the IPCC have previously estimated.  #GlobalWarming #ClimateChange #ParisAgreement #ClimateScience,in a scenario where emissions are not rapidly cut the world will likely exceed the paris 15c limit in the late 2020s or early 2030s rather than in the next few years according to carbon brief analysis the analysis uses both the latest global surface temperature data and climate model simulations click the link in our bio to read the full analysis global temperatures in 2023 blew past expectations to set the warmest year on record even topping 15c in one of the main datasetsthis warmth has continued into 2024 meaning that this year is also on track to potentially pass 15c in one or more datasets however crossing 15c in one or even two years is not the same as exceeding the 15c limit under the paris agreement the goal is generally considered to refer to longterm warming rather than annual temperatures that include the shortterm influence of natural fluctuations in the climate such as el ni o nonetheless recent warming has led to renewed debate around whether the world might imminently pass the 15c paris agreement limit sooner than climate scientists and the ipcc have previously estimated #globalwarming #climatechange #parisagreement #climatescience

The production use and disposal of plastics is responsible for around 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions and they are typically made from fossil fuels.  Carbon Brief analysis shows that without any agreement to cut plastic production emissions from plastics could consume half of the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. One expert tells Carbon Brief that the best outcome possible for the negotiations is to ratify a global target to limit plastics production coupled with legally binding national targets. However she warns that oil-producing countries are likely to veto any such proposal.

For the first time average global surface temperatures exceeded 1.5C above pre-industrial levels in most leading datasets.  This does not mean the Paris Agreement s 1.5C limit has been breached as that refers to long-term warming. However it s a clear signal that the world is nearing this critical threshold.  If global emissions remain on the current trajectory the world will likely firmly pass 1.5C in the late 2020s or early 2030s as shown in the first chart above.  In the latest State of the Climate report Carbon Brief unpacks the latest data from the oceans atmosphere cryosphere and surface temperatures. The charts above illustrate some of the report s findings.2  The second chart shows global surface temperature records from five different datasets: NASA NOAA the Met Office Hadley Centre/University of East Anglia s (UEA) HadCRUT5 Berkeley Earth and Copernicus ERA5.3  The third chart shows each month of 2024 in black compared to all prior years since 1940. Each year is coloured based on the decade in which it occurred with the clear warming over time visible as well as the margin by which both 2023 and 2024 exceeded past years.4  The fourth chart shows five different modern sea level rise datasets (blue lines) along with satellite altimeter measurements as assessed by NASA (in black) after 1993. (As sea level rise data has not yet been released for the whole year the 2024 value is estimated based on data through to October.)5  The final figure shows both Arctic (red line) and Antarctic (blue line) sea ice extent for each day of the year along with how it compares to the historical range (corresponding shading).

In total low-carbon energy sources   renewables and nuclear   provided 40.9% of the world s electricity.  The growth in clean energy is particularly stark in China where clean electricity additions met 81% of demand growth in 2024 as shown in chart two.  Clean electricity growth   which includes modest hydro and nuclear power growth   is expected to outpace electricity demand growth by 2030. This is illustrated in chart three.  Despite record renewable growth global power-sector emissions hit an  all-time high  in 2024 according to Ember s analysis.  Embers  analysis finds that the increase in fossil-fuel generation was in particular due to hotter temperatures in 2024 which drove up electricity demand in key regions such as India.Click the link in our bio to learn more about how Ember is interpreting the power sector data.#PowerSector #Emissions #Renewables #EnergyTransition,in 2024 renewables solar in particular continued to grow at record speed according to data compiled by thinktank emberenergyresearch as shown in the first chart above solar added more than twice as much generation in 2024 as any other source in total lowcarbon energy sources renewables and nuclear provided 409 of the world s electricity the growth in clean energy is particularly stark in china where clean electricity additions met 81 of demand growth in 2024 as shown in chart two clean electricity growth which includes modest hydro and nuclear power growth is expected to outpace electricity demand growth by 2030 this is illustrated in chart three despite record renewable growth global powersector emissions hit an alltime high in 2024 according to ember s analysis embers analysis finds that the increase in fossilfuel generation was in particular due to hotter temperatures in 2024 which drove up electricity demand in key regions such as indiaclick the link in our bio to learn more about how ember is interpreting the power sector data#powersector #emissions #renewables #energytransition

It s also reminiscent of Joy Division s iconic  Unknown Pleasures  album cover  It shows the distribution of half-hours in each year since 2009 arranged according to the share of fossil fuels during each time period. (Half-hours are the time period currently used for electricity market  settlement  when contracts for supply and demand are settled up.)2  The second chart communicates how unprecedented it is for fossil fuels to be meeting such low shares of demand on the GB grid also showing the share of electricity generated by fossil fuels in each half-hour period.During 2023 there were just 16 half-hour periods with less than 5% fossil fuels. In 2022 there were only five. In contrast there have already been 75 half-hours with less than 5% fossil fuels in 2024 to date.3  The shift to ever lower fossil fuel use is also illustrated in chart 3 which shows daily average shares starting to regularly drop below 10% in Dec 2023 and Apr 2024.

There is significant debate in the scientific community about whether rapid Arctic warming and sea ice loss could disrupt atmospheric circulation patterns and lead to cold-air outbreaks in the northern hemisphere mid-latitude regions.  In a new analysis Carbon Brief shows that few places in the world have seen an increase in extreme cold days over the past 55 years.  If climate change is influencing atmospheric circulation any effects on extreme cold appear to be more than compensated by the rapid winter warming the world has experienced.To help assess the effects of climate change on extreme cold events Carbon Brief calculated how the temperatures of the coldest 5% of the days of the year have changed since the 1970s. Map 1 above shows the results for every grid cell on the Earth s land (a size approximately equivalent to 100km by 100km). Grid cells coloured red experienced a decrease in extreme cold days blue had more extreme cold days.Another way to assess changes in cold events is to look at the change in the number of days where any hour of the day   that is the daily minimum temperature   is below freezing.

The report comes as countries approach the February 2025 deadline to submit their next nationally determined contributions (NDCs) setting mitigation targets for 2035.  Published by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) the report charts the  gap  between where emissions are headed under current policies and commitments over the coming decade.  As the chart shows current policies put the world on track for 2.9C of warming by 2100 though this could be reduced to 2.4-2.6C if all existing NDCs are met (with a 50% chance). The dotted grey line in the chart shows a scenario with no new climate policies after 2010 dark blue shows existing policies already implemented and mid and light blue lines show additional conditional and unconditional NDCs. The pale red line shows emissions consistent with a below 2C trajectory the red line shows emissions consistent with a 1.5C trajectory.  However unless global emissions in 2030 are brought below the levels implied by current NDCs a pathway to 1.5C with no or limited overshoot becomes  impossible  the report says and  strongly  increases the challenge of limiting warming to 2C.Click the link in our bio for more details about the report.#ParisAgreement #GlobalEmissions #GlobalWarming #ClimateChange,countries must deliver a quantum leap in ambition if the world is to meet the paris goal of limiting global warming to well below 2c and pursuing efforts to stay under 15c a new un report says the report comes as countries approach the february 2025 deadline to submit their next nationally determined contributions ndcs setting mitigation targets for 2035 published by the un environment programme unep the report charts the gap between where emissions are headed under current policies and commitments over the coming decade as the chart shows current policies put the world on track for 29c of warming by 2100 though this could be reduced to 2426c if all existing ndcs are met with a 50 chance the dotted grey line in the chart shows a scenario with no new climate policies after 2010 dark blue shows existing policies already implemented and mid and light blue lines show additional conditional and unconditional ndcs the pale red line shows emissions consistent with a below 2c trajectory the red line shows emissions consistent with a 15c trajectory however unless global emissions in 2030 are brought below the levels implied by current ndcs a pathway to 15c with no or limited overshoot becomes impossible the report says and strongly increases the challenge of limiting warming to 2cclick the link in our bio for more details about the report#parisagreement #globalemissions #globalwarming #climatechange

A Carbon Brief and guardian investigation reveals that 70 out of 137 nations submitting UN plans do not pledge to protect 30% of their land and sea by 2030 despite signing up to do so in a global deal just three years ago. Some countries set even lower targets while others avoid specific commitments altogether.As the chart shows this includes biodiversity-rich nations like  Indonesia  Peru and  South Africa as well as developed countries such as  Finland and  Switzerland. Together they represent over one-third of Earth s land surface.  The chart shows countries that have submitted NBSAPs.

According to the study if consumers with higher dietary emissions reduced their red meat consumption in favour of more legumes and nuts global food-system emissions would fall by 32%.  At the same time improving the diets of  underconsuming  populations would result in a 15% increase in dietary emissions.  The authors suggest that changing the food choices of consumers could not only contribute to mitigating climate change but also to addressing inequality and food security.The lead author of the study also told Carbon Brief: I see food as a right so I work with the perspective that each of us should be allowed to choose the best practice to eat  It s important to ensure that [vulnerable groups] still have enough nutrition from animal-based products  There s still some room for the rich people to save some good resources for the poor ones .

This likely amounts to more than 8% of all international climate finance in 2024 as visualised in the third slide.

Carbon Brief takes a detailed look at the question and finds that there is increasing evidence of an acceleration in the rate of warming over the past 15 years as the chart above shows.  Between 1970 and 2008 the world warmed at an approximately linear rate   by 0.18C per decade. However in recent years the rise in global surface temperatures has climbed above this long-term trend with eight of the past nine years showing warming levels above what would be expected given the historical warming rate.

The reduction in CO2 emissions was driven by the surge in clean energy additions which is driving fossil fuel power into reverse. These shifts are shown in chart 2  which shows the year-on-year change in China s monthly electricity generation by source. lean power expansion (yellow and blue) started to exceed electricity demand growth in recent months pushing coal and gas power (grey) in the opposite direction.

As illustrated in the first chart this is an area nearly the size of Birmingham the nation s second most populous city.  Tree-planting can help the UK meet its climate targets by removing CO2 as well as improving biodiversity and providing protection from flooding. However UK tree planting rates have largely stalled since 2020 according to data from government body Forest Research.  The most recent dataset released on 20 June shows that only 20660 hectares of new woodlands were planted in 2023-24.

The Netherlands increased its absolute share of renewable generation by close to 30% since 2019 as shown in the first chart. Nearly half the electricity produced in the Netherlands is now renewable according to the Dutch Central Bureau for Statistics. This was predominantly wind generation with the country adding more wind power than any other country in the EU between 2019 and 2023.   Latvia also saw significant growth with the share of renewables jumping from 49.5% in 2019 to 76.6% in 2023. This 27.1% increase is particularly key for the country as it continues to target reducing its dependence on energy imports from Russia.  Slovakia meanwhile was the only country to see a dip in its share of renewable energy when comparing 2019 and 2023. This was minor falling just 0.65% from 23.57% to 22.92%. The country has one of the smallest energy demands in Europe and saw a drop in hydro driven by droughts in 2022.

A surge in far-right MEPs could result in a right-wing majority coalition within parliament.  This in turn could jeopardise the next phase of the EU s climate ambitions including negotiations over a European Commission proposal to reduce emissions by 90% by 2040.  In contrast as the chart above shows parties that are further to the left have backed more ambitious emissions targets.   The relatively centrist S&D and Renew Europe Now groupings support the proposed 90% goal for 2040.   Meanwhile other parties have gone even further. The European Green Party has proposed a  revised EU climate law  with a 2030 target that goes  beyond  the current 55% goal and achieves net-zero by 2040.

As shown in the first chart India s coal production has rapidly expanded under prime minister Narendra Modi.That expansion since 2014 has come with impacts on India s coal communities and the environment including:  forced evictions  deforestation  rising emissions  India s coal reserves are concentrated in states with significant Indigenous populations such as Chhattisgarh. Local communities who traditionally have strong links to land and forests have suffered disproportionately from coal mining-induced displacement and environmental impacts. The map in slide 3 shows India s coal reserves by state.  Korba a town in Chhattisgarh is home to three of India s largest mines which have all expanded rapidly in recent years. In slide 5 for each mine the dark purple outlined square shows permitted annual coal capacity in 2009. Permitted expansions in subsequent years are shown in shades of purple.

As shown in the first chart emissions in 2025 are expected to be 36.0MtCO2e while 15 years later they are still forecast to be as high as 35.7MtCO2e.  This is because emissions savings from SAFs will be almost totally offset by a growth in flights leaving UK aviation emissions virtually unchanged between now and 2040.  The UK government has resisted pressure to curb the demand for air travel despite warnings from experts that such actions are vital for reducing aviation emissions.Meanwhile the only SAFs that are currently available in the UK are fuels made from used cooking oil and other waste oils which are collected from restaurants and factories. As illustrated in chart 2  waste oil-based SAF use is expected to rise around 15-fold from current levels within a decade.Chart 3  shows that as of 2023 waste cooking oil collected in the UK only accounted for 7% of the country s SAF production. And there is mounting evidence that the demand for imported cooking oil in the UK and Europe is being met with virgin palm oil that has been fraudulently passed off as waste.   This would cancel out the fuel s emissions savings due to the land clearances for oil palm plantations.Chart 4  shows that the UK s target for power-to-liquid fuels   an alternative to waste oil-based SAFs which can be made using green hydrogen and carbon captured from the air   are lower than EU targets.Click the link in our bio for the full analysis  #UK #Aviation #SAFs #Emissions #SustainableAviationFuel,uk government targets for sustainable aviation fuels safs will only cut emissions from the sector by 08 in 2040 carbon brief analysis shows as shown in the first chart emissions in 2025 are expected to be 360mtco2e while 15 years later they are still forecast to be as high as 357mtco2e this is because emissions savings from safs will be almost totally offset by a growth in flights leaving uk aviation emissions virtually unchanged between now and 2040 the uk government has resisted pressure to curb the demand for air travel despite warnings from experts that such actions are vital for reducing aviation emissionsmeanwhile the only safs that are currently available in the uk are fuels made from used cooking oil and other waste oils which are collected from restaurants and factories as illustrated in chart 2 waste oilbased saf use is expected to rise around 15fold from current levels within a decadechart 3 shows that as of 2023 waste cooking oil collected in the uk only accounted for 7 of the country s saf production and there is mounting evidence that the demand for imported cooking oil in the uk and europe is being met with virgin palm oil that has been fraudulently passed off as waste this would cancel out the fuel s emissions savings due to the land clearances for oil palm plantationschart 4 shows that the uk s target for powertoliquid fuels an alternative to waste oilbased safs which can be made using green hydrogen and carbon captured from the air are lower than eu targetsclick the link in our bio for the full analysis #uk #aviation #safs #emissions #sustainableaviationfuel

As chart 1  shows in the first half of 2024 newspapers published 16 editorials attacking Miliband. In the second half of the year since Labour s election win this increased to 45   roughly two every week.  Right-leaning outlets such as the Sun and the Daily Mail repeatedly called Miliband an  eco-zealot  a  madman  and a  hysterical eco-obsessive  due to his support for net-zero policies.  In 2024 unprecedented numbers of these editorials opposed climate action in general as well as renewable energy specifically. A record 44 of the editorials published in 2024 argued for less climate action. This is the third record-breaking year in a row for such editorials in UK newspapers as chart  2  above shows.  For a brief period peaking in 2020 these right-leaning publications appeared to have shifted in their attitudes.

At COP16 countries agreed to the first-ever mechanism requiring companies that use digital sequence information (DSI) to contribute to biodiversity conservation. The fund officially opens on 25 February.  Companies use DSI to develop products like medicines cosmetics and drought-resistant cropsoften without compensating the global-south nations and Indigenous communities where the genetic material originated.
