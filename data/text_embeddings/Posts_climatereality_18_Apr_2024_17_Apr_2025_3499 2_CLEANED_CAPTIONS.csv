On the key issues like climate finance and the transition away from fossil fuels this is   yet again   the bare minimum. We cannot continue to rely on last-minute half measures. Leaders today shirk their responsibility by focusing on long-term aspirational goals that extend far beyond their own terms in office. To meet the challenge of our time we need real action at the scale of months and years not decades and quarter-centuries.This experience in Baku illuminates deeper flaws in the COP process including the outsized influence of fossil fuel interests that has hobbled this process since its inception. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been particularly obstructive. Putting the future of humanity at severe risk in order to make more money is truly disgraceful behavior. Reforming this process so that the polluters are not in effective control must be a priority.On climate finance our primary task in the coming years must be to not only fulfill and build upon the financial commitments agreed to at COP 29 but to unleash even larger flows of affordable and fair private capital for developing countries. Ultimately coming out of COP 29 we must transform disappointment into determination. We can solve the climate crisis. Whether we do so in time to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement will depend on what comes next. #onthegroundcop29,as our founder and chairman algore said tonightwhile the agreement reached at #cop29 avoids immediate failure it is far from a success on the key issues like climate finance and the transition away from fossil fuels this is yet again the bare minimum we cannot continue to rely on lastminute half measures leaders today shirk their responsibility by focusing on longterm aspirational goals that extend far beyond their own terms in office to meet the challenge of our time we need real action at the scale of months and years not decades and quartercenturiesthis experience in baku illuminates deeper flaws in the cop process including the outsized influence of fossil fuel interests that has hobbled this process since its inception the kingdom of saudi arabia has been particularly obstructive putting the future of humanity at severe risk in order to make more money is truly disgraceful behavior reforming this process so that the polluters are not in effective control must be a priorityon climate finance our primary task in the coming years must be to not only fulfill and build upon the financial commitments agreed to at cop 29 but to unleash even larger flows of affordable and fair private capital for developing countries ultimately coming out of cop 29 we must transform disappointment into determination we can solve the climate crisis whether we do so in time to meet the goals of the paris agreement will depend on what comes next #onthegroundcop29
