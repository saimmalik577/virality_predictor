Aruba has drafted a constitutional amendment that would make it the second country in the world to recognize that nature has inherent rights. The amendment also affirms that people are entitled to a  clean healthy and sustainable environment . The draft bill was announced by the country s nature minister Ursell Arends earlier this month. It would require the government to  take preventive measures to protect against the negative consequences of climate change. If the amendment is approved Aruba will be the second nation in the world after Ecuador to recognize the rights of nature in its constitution. About 30 countries   including Uganda Bolivia and Spain   have recognized the inherent rights of particular species or ecosystems.This potential amendment will also be the first time Aruba has altered its constitution since 1986. Aruba s constitutional amendment would also require that the government periodically look at the state of the environment and issue reports every five years.Plastic pollution overfishing and waste generated in great part by visitors are some of the environmental impacts facing the small island nation. Aruba is also experiencing increasing sea level rise coastal erosion and ocean acidification due to climate change.

The country will pursue 21 marine conservation initiatives with the money.As reported by Reuters some of the initiatives will include the development of two marine parks: one will be located in the Ionian Sea and the other park will be established in the Aegean Sea. The exact borders will be determined following a scientific review expected to be complete by 2025. The parks will cover about 32% of the country s waters.With 29417 islands and over 20700 kilometers (over 12862 miles) of coastline Greece relies on the seas surrounding its islands. Marine conservation is important for the country s culture and economy but Mitsotakis also noted that efforts to protect the seas around Greece will contribute to the country s efforts to curb the effects of climate change.Greece plans to address some of these ocean conservation and climate concerns through Marine Protected Areas sustainable fisheries offshore wind development enhanced maritime security decarbonization of maritime transportation and sustainable tourism models. Greece also plans to reduce plastic pollution by 50% and microplastic pollution by 30% by the end of this decade.  Link in bio.

In the coming round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) countries must commit to slashing their collective yearly greenhouse gas emissions by 42 percent by the end of the decade and by 57 percent by 2035 a press release from UNEP said.Otherwise the annual report says the chance of meeting the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average will disappear within a few years.The report found that failing to increase the ambition of new NDCs and immediately starting to deliver on them would place the planet on a course for an increase in temperature from 2.6 to 3.1 degrees Celsius this century bringing debilitating impacts to people the environment and economies.The report also looked at what would be needed to limit global heating to less than two degrees Celsius. For this to be possible emissions would need to fall by 28 percent by the end of the decade and 37 percent by 2035 compared to 2019 levels.

The ocean has experienced roughly a two percent oxygen loss since 1960 which represents an extensive amount due to its enormous volume.The authors of the study warned that the planet is approaching critical aquatic deoxygenation thresholds that will eventually impact several other planetary boundaries.

Whales   or tohor  as M ori call them   guided their ancestors across the Pacific Ocean. Today those groups consider themselves to be guardians for the largest animals under the sea.But as of recent whales are not simply animals in this region and instead are viewed as legal persons. Conservationists hope this will lead to legal protections. A number of types of whales are found in the Pacific Ocean including blue gray minke sperm southern right and of particular importance to M ori humpback. And while there is some protection for the mammals within the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary where the International Whaling Commission has banned all types of commercial whaling there is no formal legislation.Proposed legislation from this treaty would be built around several pillars: monitoring penalties for killing whales and even whale insurance.

The specific effects that human drugs can have on wildlife has been well documented. One study found that when exposed to antidepressants present in their habitat crayfish spent more time seeking food which could put them in greater danger from predators. Another study found signs of methamphetamine addiction in trout that were exposed to water polluted with these drugs. A study of Florida s waterways revealed 58 different kinds of prescription drugs present in 93 bonefish with a single fish having as many as 17 different drugs present.There are a wide variety of drugs entering the environment from legal drugs and prescription medications like caffeine and antidepressants to illegal drugs such as methamphetamine and cocaine. Not only can these drugs lead to behavioral changes in wildlife but they can also leach into groundwater used for drinking water.The paper cited a recent study that looked at pollution of active pharmaceutical ingredients worldwide. In that study researchers analyzed 61 drugs in samples of river water from 1052 sites in 104 countries and 43% of sites had at least one drug present at levels higher than ecological safety limits.The authors of the paper are urging scientists to develop  greener  drugs that will still be effective for humans but will be safer for wildlife. The recommended updates include developing drugs that more quickly and fully biodegrade as well as updating wastewater treatment infrastructure so that it can remove pharmaceutical pollutants before they reach the environment.

A new report from Marine Conservation Society has determined an 80% decline in the amount of plastic bags found washed up on beaches in the past 10 years. The report links the decline in plastic bag waste to the enacting of fees for single-use plastic bags at large supermarket retailers in 2015.As the Centre for Public Impact reported England first issued a law requiring retailers with 250 or more full-time employees to charge at least 5 pence per each single-use plastic bag. Fees typically range between 5 and 25 pence per bag. In 2023 the UK government shared a report that found plastic bag usage at major supermarkets declined by 98% from 2014 to 2023.Although the Marine Conservation Society praised the decline of plastic bags washing up on beaches since the bag fees were initiated the organization noted that more work is needed to further reduce plastic bag pollution along with other forms of waste. Recent beach surveys from Marine Conservation Society found an increase in drinks-related plastic litter and an overall 1.2% increase in plastic litter across UK beaches despite the decline in plastic bag litter.

New research has found that the discoloration could be from the exposure of minerals from thawing permafrost.For the first time researchers have sampled and documented some of these degraded waterways including 75 locations across part of the Brooks Range in northern Alaska. The researchers said that as the climate continues to be affected by global heating these contaminated rivers and streams could seriously impact fisheries and drinking water in Arctic watersheds.The affected rivers are located on federal lands   including Kobuk Valley and Gates of the Arctic National Parks   managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service Bureau of Land Management and NPS. The river and stream-staining minerals can affect the health of fish and in turn the humans who consume them.The problem of Alaska s rusting rivers is increasing. Healthy areas are turning into degraded habitats with less fish and invertebrates. Rural communities that rely on the rivers for their drinking water may need to use treatment methods eventually while fishing stocks could also be affected.

By 2019 the town began accepting proposals from developers over what to do with the empty site.According to the project developers and owners the project will provide more affordable clean energy to Fort Edward while also contributing toward New York s goals for a clean energy transition including installing 3000 megawatts of clean energy by 2030 and reaching zero-emissions electricity by 2040.As explained by the U.S. Department of Energy community solar projects work by collecting solar energy at one site and sharing the energy to local residents and businesses who pay a subscription fee. This makes solar energy more accessible to homes and businesses that may not be able to install their own solar panels and can help reduce energy bills and make the community more resilient against power outages.The companies behind the Fort Edward solar project are also working on a similar brownfield redevelopment project in Queensbury New York that will turn a former factory site into a 6 megawatt solar site.

Global heating is causing polar ice to melt which is altering how fast Earth rotates making each day longer. It is a shift that will accelerate as long as humans continue to burn fossil fuels that produce planet-warming greenhouse gases.The length of a day is changing by milliseconds but it is enough to potentially interfere with technologies that depend on exact timekeeping such as GPS navigation financial transactions and the internet.As Earth warms and ice sheets and glaciers melt the meltwater flows toward the equator changing the shape of the planet. It becomes flatter at the poles and bulges at the middle slowing down its rotation. In addition the moon s gravitational pull on the planet s land and oceans has been causing Earth s day to become steadily longer over geological time. While humans may not physically perceive the change it can interfere with systems that rely on atomic time which is extremely precise and based on specific atoms  frequency - thus still having an overall impact on our daily lives.

It is the second mass bleaching in the past decade  Across the Pacific Atlantic and Indian Ocean basins heat stress at levels high enough to cause bleaching has been extensive as monitored remotely by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) s Coral Reef Watch (CRW).CRW bases its sea surface temperature data on information gathered from NOAA and partner satellites from 1985 to the present.For a bleaching event to be  global  there must be significant bleaching in the three ocean basins over a one-year period. Since February 2023 mass bleaching has been detected among reefs in at least 54 nations and territories CRW said.Bleaching occurs when extreme water temperatures trigger corals to expel the vibrant algae that live in a symbiotic relationship with them providing the corals with nutrients.As with the current global bleaching event the other three   1998 2010 and 2014 to 2017   happened at the same time as the El Ni o climate pattern known to cause warmer sea surface temperatures. The combination of El Ni o and climate change have resulted in ocean temperatures breaking long-standing records over the past year.Mass coral reef bleaching has been recorded throughout the tropics since early last year including in Florida the Caribbean the eastern Tropical Pacific the GBR Brazil the Red Sea Persian Gulf the Gulf of Aden and the South Pacific.

The reason for this has been said to be because the large amounts of spores ferns produce are widely distributed by the wind. This  competitive  success has been used as a foundation of ecological theories for how recolonization happens following disasters.Recently however research has demonstrated that competition is not the only means of recovery. Facilitation between ferns and surrounding species has been found to play a critical role. The study s authors believe positive interactions within ecosystems need to be reexamined instead of defaulting to a competition-based framework.

By comparison the same year saw 92.3 million metric tons of aquatic life products from global capture fisheries. Inland fisheries generated 11.3 million metric tons while marine capture produced 81 million metric tons.According to the UN this is the first time that aquaculture production has outpaced capture fisheries although it said that both are essential for feeding the global population.In total fisheries and aquaculture production produced 223.2 million metric tons of aquatic life most of which (185.4 million metric tons) was animals. About 37.8 million metric tons produced were algae which is expected to be an important food source for the growing human population by 2050.The UN has noted that the rise in farmed fishing is a way to reduce food insecurity as well as a way to minimize overfishing and unsustainable practices in the capture fishing industry especially as the report predicted a 10% increase in aquatic animal production by 2032 to meet an estimated 12% increase in demand for consumption.But aquaculture is not without its environmental concerns. As KQED reported aquaculture can pollute waterways from the excess nutrients and fecal waste generated in aquatic farms. For larger fish smaller fish may still be wild-caught to feed the farmed fish. Farmed fish can also be vulnerable to disease transmission and they may pass those illnesses on to wild fish the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported.  Link in bio.

The average sea surface temperature in the 1870s was 79.6 degrees Fahrenheit but had increased to 81 degrees Fahrenheit by the 2010s.Ocean surface warming in the Indian Ocean   coupled with heat built up in the first 6561.7 feet below   can have substantial effects on the region s monsoon season. The weather pattern brings roughly 70 percent of India s yearly rainfall while affecting climate in other South Asian nations.The increased warming could also cause more intense and frequent extreme weather like flooding and tropical cyclones in addition to sea level rise from thermal expansion in the 40 countries that border the Indian Ocean. Thermal expansion is responsible for more than 50 percent of sea level rise exceeding that caused by sea ice and glacial melt.Marine heat waves can lead to coral bleaching kelp forest degradation and seagrass loss. They can also contribute to the rapid intensification of tropical cyclones.

They used  sonobuoys  to detect marine sounds and ultimately gathered about 3900 hours  worth of sounds to review. In the analysis the researchers specifically sought out calls of Antarctic blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia) which are the largest animals on the planet but are currently critically endangered according to the IUCN Red List.The researchers explained that the whales  song sounds are considered a 3-unit vocalization (written as A B and C throughout the study) and together the full call is referenced as the Z-call.They found that Unit A calls were the most widely distributed in the recordings from the sonobuoys. Unit A calls and Z-calls were more prominent in late summer and early fall. D-calls or non-song calls were detected most in the summer during the feeding season.According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Antarctic blue whales are not just the largest animal on the planet but also the loudest. Their calls can reach about 188 decibels making them louder than a jet engine and they can be heard hundreds of miles away. This makes it easier and more cost-effective for researchers to use audio to study the whales.While the findings reveal regular calls from the whales and give hope for a potential increase in the population the study authors emphasized that more research is needed to determine whether that means the whale population is actually rebounding.

The richest 1% which includes 77 million people such as billionaires and millionaires surpassed their share of the carbon budget in just the first 10 days of 2025. By comparison someone in the poorest 50% of the global population would use up just their share of the annual global carbon budget in 1022 days.Not only are the ultra-wealthy using well beyond their share of the carbon budget but the ways that they are emitting are not providing economic benefits to society. The use of luxury private jets and super-yachts alongside polluting investments led the 50 richest billionaires to emit more carbon in 2.78 hours than it takes for an average person in Britain to emit in their entire lifetime.In order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius the wealthiest 1% of people globally need to reduce their emissions per capita by 97% by 2030. However Oxfam GB found that the 1% is currently on track to reduce emissions by only 5%.  Link in bio.

Though the changes to the ozone hole explained in the bulletin are positive the report found that atmospheric events can have big impacts on how the hole develops periodically. There are still some gaps in the understanding of these variables and WMO said scientists will continue detailed monitoring of the ozone layer to interpret any unforeseen changes.

By using the new method to evaluate the effects of climate change on marine life researchers found negative impacts on behavior physiology reproduction and physical development for fish and invertebrates.The researchers also estimated how acidification which happens as increasing amounts of carbon dioxide in the air dissolve into the ocean could continue to impact marine life in the future both with and without intervention.Even in a lower carbon emissions scenario the researchers determined that acidification will impact about 50% of biological processes in invertebrates and 30% of biological processes in fish still higher than previous estimates.

Wizz Air recently placed an order for up to 525000 metric tons of SAF for over the next 15 years from Firefly as a way of investing in the ideaAccording to the International Energy Agency the aviation industry is responsible for about 2% of global carbon emissions but advancements such as SAF can reduce the impact of air travel. However as The Guardian reported developing SAF can be cost- and resource-restrictive. It can be more expensive to develop than conventional aviation fuel and many SAFs rely on materials with limited stocks such as spent cooking oil or other food waste.Firefly s fuel is still undergoing regulatory testing but the company has plans to construct a factory for its operations in Harwich in Essex EnglandIn addition to helping the airline meet its goal of powering 10% of flights with SAF by 2030 the order for Firefly s SAF could also help Wizz Air meet the EU s regulations which will require 20% SAF for flights starting in the EU by 2030 and 70% SAF by 2050.

Many are in decline due to climate change but the specific cause has been difficult to pinpoint.After a review of 180 years of literature a team of researchers discovered that bumblebees seemed to survive at temperatures as high as 36 degrees Celsius while 30 to 32 degrees was the optimal range for development though that window could differ between biogeographical conditions and species.The right temperature means minimal metabolic expenditure while warmth in excess of that window can lead to dangerous heat stress. This means adaptation to higher temperatures could prove hard for bumblebees.The researchers said that while bumblebees have a number of behavioral adaptations for thermoregulation they may not be adequate to adapt to climate change.Honeybee studies have shown that hotter nest temperatures sap the strength of queen bees and weaken their ability to reproduce leading to smaller worker bees and less optimum conditions. If heat affects bumblebees in a similar way global heating could be a direct cause of their decline.

As the trees in the Eastern Amazon and Cerrado regions absorb rainfall brought about by moisture coming from the Atlantic they later release water vapor into the air through transpiration which then brings rainfall to much of Brazil and other parts of South America. But the trees the process requires are being destroyed leading to rivers drying up and areas that were once green now resembling deserts.As the Amazon s northeast is being destroyed not only is it disrupting the water cycle and leading to further droughts elsewhere but it s also releasing an enormous amount of carbon into the atmosphere.The Cerrado region in the country s southeast which is also a crucial part of the water cycle is in the midst of its worst drought in at least 700 years and more than 59% of the country is under stress from drought.

PFAS are common in firefighting foams. But even 31% of samples from areas without known contamination sources had PFAS levels that exceeded proposed U.S. EPA limits for PFAS in drinking water. About 69% of samples from areas with unknown contamination sources exceeded the standards set by Health Canada.The authors did note however that these higher concentrations of PFAS were detected in source water such as surface water and groundwater but not in drinking water to which the safe limits apply.The authors warned that these findings were likely lower than the actual number of PFAS in source water as they monitored for a limited number of PFAS that some governments regulate. Further PFAS in consumer products could also be higher than previous estimates providing more contamination sources.  Link in bio.

Up to 20 percent of the planet s oil production could be taken up by plastic manufacturing and processing by 2040 using 15 percent of the yearly carbon emissions budget.The researchers looked at five years of litter audit data   global surveys of environmental waste   to get an idea of types of plastic waste and their volumes. The data included more than 1500 audits from 84 countries. The audits found that 48 percent of litter was brand-name while the remainder was unbranded.To figure out production levels the team looked at data reported by major plastics companies to a circular economy organization then compared it with branded plastic pollution data.They found that 13 companies each added one percent or higher to the overall branded plastic problem. The companies all produced beverage food or tobacco products that were mostly packaged using single-use plastic.Roughly 36 percent of plastic pollution worldwide comes from single-use plastics.

Historically overlooked as a swamp this natural wetland is actually made up of coastal mangroves sawgrass marshes and pinewood flats. These incredible habitats are home to hundreds of animal species including the threatened West Indian manatee and the endangered Florida panther. Ecologically the flooded grasslands act as a natural filter for freshwater coming down from Lake Okeechobee in central Florida this water keeps Florida Bay s ecosystems in natural balance. Economically all of this keeps the state s fisheries and coastal tourism healthy.In a Suncoast Regional Emmy Award-winning series by evergladesfoundation Florida locals share what the Everglades mean to them and why we must protect this fragile and spectacular place.

The sightings took place off the northeastern U.S. Coasts near Martha s Vineyard as well as southeast of Nantucket and according to NOAA the sightings included an unusually high number of whale species particularly endangered whales.The sightings don t necessarily mean there were 161 individual whales since some may have been counted multiple times but the recorded whale sightings were still a positive sign especially considering the high numbers of endangered species observed.The researchers observed 93 sei whales which are considered endangered under the Endangered Species Act. As stated on the NOAA website sei whales experienced major declines in the 19th and 20th centuries when around 300000 of these whales were hunted.In addition to the sei whales researchers noted three sightings of the North Atlantic right whale another endangered species humpback whales fin whales minke whales sperm whales and the rare sightings of two orcas which are not as common in this area.These sightings follow the rare observations of a gray whale off the northeastern U.S. in March by the New England Aquarium. New England Aquarium researchers observed a gray whale a species that has been considered extinct in the Atlantic Ocean for more than two centuries off the New England coast in an aerial survey. The rare gray whale sighting may be attributed to the species  adaptation to climate change scientists said.  Link in bio.  Paige Bennett.Humpback whales off the New England coast on May 25 2024.

This is the largest penalty for Clean Air Act violations at stationary sources including power plants factories and refineries the EPA said.In their complaint the EPA and DOJ alleged violations of the Clean Air Act by Marathon at almost 90 of its facilities including those in western North Dakota s Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. The agencies said the violations produced thousands of tons of unlawful pollution.Specifically the facilities run by Marathon released illegal amounts of carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which the agencies said are associated with respiratory illnesses.The settlement agreement will lower VOCs by about 110000 tons as well as methane emissions that are the equivalent of two million-plus tons of carbon dioxide.

It wreaks havoc on human health critical infrastructure the economy agriculture and the environment thereby eroding gains in human development and decreasing wellbeing especially for poor and marginalized communities in the global South.The ongoing Asia heat wave has been bringing excessive temperatures to Bangladesh Malaysia the Philippines Myanmar and Nepal causing many deaths and heat-related health issues. In Bangladesh the extreme heat has affected more than 120 million people and Myanmar experienced its hottest temperature ever recorded of 118.8 degrees Fahrenheit on April 28.In the study the researchers looked at the top 10 percent of temperatures for each country studied during the period 1991 to 2020. They then examined the 12 months from May 15 2023 to May 15 of this year in order to find out the number of days temperatures were within or above the previous range.Using peer-reviewed methods the scientists then looked at how climate change had influenced each of the excessively hot days.Their conclusion was that over the past year  human-caused climate change added an average of 26 days of extreme heat (on average across all places in the world) than there would have been without a warmed planet.The report also said that in the 12 months of the study period approximately 80 percent of the world s population   about 6.3 billion people   experienced a minimum of 31 days of extreme heat.

That s because the sounds that plastics make can be very similar to the sounds that prey make leading to confusion for whales that rely on echolocation to source food.More and more research is uncovering plastic waste in the stomachs of deep-diving whales so. a team of researchers set out to find out why whales were mistaking plastic for food if they couldn t see the plastics which are often visually mistaken for food by marine life. The researchers collected trash like plastic bags plastic bottles bottles and balloons from a marine environment as well as pieces of dead squids that had been collected from the stomach of a dead sperm whale then tested the samples in a sonar transponder. The transponder and samples were placed underwater to mimic the whales  feeding environments and the researchers tested the acoustics at different frequencies since different whales may use varying frequencies when hunting.According to the study authors all of the plastic waste tested had similar if not stronger acoustic target strengths when compared with the samples of prey meaning it is likely that deep-diving whales are mistaking plastics for food by confusing the acoustic signals.

In 2020 scientists uncovered microplastics in human organs for the first time. Now researchers are making sense of how microplastics that are ingested can make their way from the gut to other organs.Researchers studied mice that were exposed to and ingested microplastics over a four-week period and found those microplastics moved to organ tissues of the brain liver and kidney. The team also noted metabolic differences in the colon liver and brain after the microplastic exposure.Scientists estimate that humans consume about 5 grams of microplastics per week or about enough to fill a soup spoon. Estimates suggest humans consume about 21 grams of microplastics per month and 250 grams per year. Over a lifetime of about 79 years humans may consume 20 kilograms of microplastics.The scientists plan to further their research by examining whether different diets such as a high-fat diet compared to a high-fiber diet can impact microplastic exposure and ingestion  Link in bio.

The footage shows that the bleaching extends at least as far down as 59.1 feet   the deepest reported during this mass bleaching event a press release from AMCS said. Some of the corals have begun to die in the face of record marine heat waves.Last week aerial survey data showed that 75 percent of the reef had experienced bleaching during the current bleaching event with much of it classed as  high to extreme bleaching. During climate change-driven marine heat waves extended periods of warmer ocean temperatures cause corals to become stressed which leads them to expel the algae that live in a symbiotic relationship with them. These algae not only give corals their colorful appearance but they are also their main source of energy so long periods without them can lead to starvation.Some southern reef areas have seen elevated water temperatures lasting for a record 14.57 weeks smashing the previous 11.8-week record set in April of 2020 according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data.The Great Barrier Reef s plight is directly related to human-caused climate change and no time must be lost in addressing and mitigating the source of the crisis  Link in bio.  cristenhemingwayjaynes.New video footage released on April 11 2024 shows that bleached corals on the southern part of the Great Barrier Reef extend to greater depths than has been reported during the current mass bleaching event.

It was also the longest stretch above the 1.5-degree threshold of the Paris Agreement.In May the average ocean surface temperature was 69.6 degrees Fahrenheit the warmest ever recorded for the month. It was the fourteenth record-setting month in a row for sea surface temperatures. The findings do not necessarily mean the Paris Agreement goal of global heating not exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius above the average for pre-industrial times has been breached as this target is measured by averages over decades rather than single years. However the trend does mean more extreme heat and climate-fueled weather events as well as the risk of disastrous tipping points.The data suggest this year could be hotter than 2023 which was the hottest on record.

Days earlier a polar bear was spotted in Rankin Inlet a remote but fairly populated Inuit settlement in the same territory. Experts warn that similar encounters with polar bears will likely become more common as climate change destroys their habitats and makes it more difficult to find food.According to a 2017 study published in the Wildlife Society Bulletin polar bears are more likely to attack humans when they re  nutritionally stressed  and are in  below-average body condition. Unlike other species polar bears can see humans as a potential food source making them extremely dangerous. In case of an encounter it s recommended to carry deterrents such as an air horn or bear spray and playing dead is not effective. Instead it s recommended to back away slowly and prepare to stand your ground by making loud noises and prepare for a potential fight aiming for the nose and head.As climate change worsens polar bear populations will decline as they need sea ice for habitation and for capturing seals according to a 2020 research article published in the journal Nature Climate Change.

The country s use of thermal power   particularly from coal-fired power plants   is on course to fall to 30 to 40 percent by 2040. Last year thermal energy made up 68.6 percent of the energy mix.Tokyo said nuclear power will play a major role in helping the country meet the growing energy demand from microchip factories and artificial intelligence. Japan s government had previously set a goal of becoming carbon-neutral by mid-century as well as reducing emissions by nearly 50 percent from 2013 levels by 2030.The new plans expect renewables like wind and solar to make up 40 to 50 percent of power generation by 2040. That s up from 23 percent last year and an earlier target of 38 percent by 2030.

Posts_ecowatch_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_d967_CLEANED_60.jpeg,The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has recently found that about half of all mangrove ecosystems in the world are at risk of collapsing meaning they are considered vulnerable endangered or critically endangered by the organization s Red List of Ecosystem standards  The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems measures the health and risks of specific ecosystems but this is the first time the standards have been used to assess an ecosystem at a global scale.IUCN reported that mangrove ecosystems face an increasing number of threats particularly from the effects of climate change. Frequent and severe weather events threaten the mangroves but they are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise.Mangrove ecosystems which require tropical humid environments are expanding into temperate areas because of climate change. According to IUCN agricultural use of freshwater has also limited the amount of freshwater that can reach coastal areas where mangroves typically thrive limiting the mangroves  ability to survive in their natural habitats.In a business-as-usual scenario about 25% of the global area covered by mangroves currently could be submerged over the next 50 years and about 33% of global mangrove ecosystems will be severely impacted.At the current rate the predicted mangrove losses would lead to a loss of 1.8 billion metric tons of stored carbon emissions equating to a cost to society of about $336 billion. Losing these mangrove ecosystems could also expose 2.1 million people to coastal flooding.  Link in bio.

This target was established by scientists to limit catastrophic impacts of climate change.Many countries have set climate targets including net-zero emissions goals to reduce emissions by 2050 as outlined by the Paris Agreement. But scientists now warn we are on track to breach the 1.5 degree Celsius limit for 2024 the first time this has happened for a calendar year. However Earth has already experienced a global average temperature of 1.5 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial times for 12 consecutive months. From February 2023 through Jan 2024 the temperature was 1.52 degrees Celsius higher than the global average temperature from 1850 to 1900.Now 2024 could be the first calendar year meaning from January 1 to December 31 to surpass 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming compared to pre-industrial global temperatures and it s set to be the hottest on record based on data from January through October of this year.

Plaintiffs argued the opinion failed to adequately evaluate the possibility of future Gulf of Mexico oil spills without requiring sufficient protections for imperiled sea turtles whales and other threatened and endangered marine species from offshore drilling operationsThe court s ruling affirms that the government cannot continue to turn a blind eye to the widespread persistent harms that offshore oil and gas development inflicts on wildlife and this decision means the Fisheries Service must comply with the law to put in place meaningful safeguards for the Gulf s rarest marine species.The court found multiple violations of the law in the biological opinion including an erroneous assumption that a disastrous soil spill such as the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon would not happen even though a NMFS analysis found that such a spill was to be expected. It also assumed wildlife populations in the Gulf were not affected by the spill despite evidence to the contrary.

But according to a new report by Unearthed a Greenpeace investigative journalism team the initiative members have actually produced more than 1000 times the amount of plastic than they ve cleaned up in the 2019 to 2023 timeframe.The Unearthed team examined data provided by Wood Mackenzie a consultancy firm and found that five companies that are major players in the alliance including Shell ExxonMobil TotalEnergies ChevronPhillips and Dow were producing more plastic in just two days than the total amount of plastic the alliance has cleaned up since 2019. These companies produced 132 million metric tons of polyethylene and polypropylene alone in the 2019-2023 timeframe not including other types of plastics or the plastic produced by other member companies in the alliance.

A once-thriving population of approximately 150 stems had by 2021 been reduced to six unhealthy fragments.Saltwater inundation from rising sea levels soil depletion due to high tides and hurricanes and mammal populations eating the plants had been putting pressure on the remaining cacti.The Key tree cactus had been succumbing to environmental pressures for a long time and was federally listed as endangered in 1984. From 1994 to 2007 its abundance decreased by 84 percent.When it was clear the Key Largo tree cactus population in Florida would not survive the researchers replanted its remaining green material in greenhouses or controlled outdoor settings but there are no known naturally growing plants remaining in the U.S.  Link in bio.  cristenhemingwayjaynes.The Key Largo tree cactus was initially found growing in the U.S. in 1992 at a single site.

Combined with low rainfall   the conditions for which were found the be 2.4 times more likely due to climate change   and dry vegetation to fuel the fires the risk of fire compounded.The researchers used combined weather data with computer models to analyze how how much of a factor climate change played in the blazes comparing the pre-industrial climate to a more modern climate at about 1.3 C above that baseline.They also used the Fire Weather Index which  considers the hot dry and windy conditions that drive wildfires  and further analyzed the total rainfall from October to December which normally marks the tail-end of the fire season and used the drought code to determine how the duration of the fire season is changing in the region.They found that the conditions that fueled the fires are expected to happen about once every 17 years which is an increase of 35% compared to a pre-industrial climate. The Fire Weather Index was also found to be 6% more intense compared to an environment without climate change which has increased somewhat exponentially in recent years.The fires have destroyed an estimated 16000 structures and killed at least 28 people with thousands being dropped from their home insurance mere months before the fires hit.

Her first film  Dear Ocean  won second place at HUFF and we celebrate the blue planet and its heroes alongside her.Here s what Brynne had to say: It s not everyday you get to watch your own life story play out across the big screen. In April Giovana Roskosz Reis (giireis) and I headed to the to Houston Underwater Film Festival (HUFF) in Houston Texas to watch our short film  Dear Ocean  debut at the MATCH Theatre. This film was a beautiful collaboration piece with Giovana as director and director of photography and myself starring and writing the film. Our goal was to tell my unique life story as a love letter written to the ocean in the hopes that it would resonate with so many others who feel deeply connected to our blue planet. As environmental filmmakers our mission is to tell powerful stories of connection between human beings and the many species of our Earth in the hopes that they will influence more people to protect it. We are both so grateful that  Dear Ocean  is already doing just that. The most rewarding moment for me from HUFF was the overflow of love and comments from people both at the festival and online who shared with Giovana and myself that our film helped them feel seen and that my words helped them articulate a love for the ocean they had never quite known how to communicate to others before.   Dear Ocean  won second place at HUFF and has gone on to win  Best Student Film  at the 2024 Dana Point Film Festival in California and won the  Center of Environmental Filmmaking Award  at American University s Visions Awards as well as  Best Edited Film  by Women in Film and Video.

The half-hourly price fell to 6.57 pounds per megawatt-hour according to data from European power exchange Epex Spot.The record was a major reversal from previous low wind output when electricity was mostly supplied by gas.However the enormous fluctuations in Europe s weather have demonstrated the challenge to governments in supplying power as the transition to renewable energy speeds up. When weather in the United Kingdom is cloudy or winds are calm gas will still be used to generate electricity.As a result the UK s Labour government has a goal of quadrupling offshore wind power doubling onshore wind and tripling solar by 2030 with an overall target of 95 percent green energy.

Target 18 of the GBF included the first quantitative goal for the reduction of environmentally harmful subsidies (EHS) a news release from Earth Track said. The target committed to reducing EHS by $500 billion each year by the end of the decade.An initial review of the state of EHS in 2022 included looking at a variety of economic sectors that impact land-use changes and the extraction of resources since it is the combined effect of subsidies that drives nature and biodiversity loss.Earth Track found that governments are continuing to provide billions in subsidies tax breaks and other fundings that frustrate the goals of the GBF and the 2015 Paris Climate Accord reported The Guardian. The report uncovered channels of direct financial support being provided by nations for deforestation fossil fuel consumption and water pollution.The new EHS estimate by Earth Track is roughly $800 billion higher than in 2022   $500 billion after adjusting for inflation. The organization said the increase was due to improved data estimates for rising fossil fuel subsidies non-energy mining plastics production and inflation with fossil fuel subsidies being the biggest driver.

Previous research had found that windows are extremely hazardous for birds as they are not able to see them other than by what is reflected off their surfaces which is often viewed as open spaces to fly into. When birds do collide with windows it often leads to death head injuries that can be fatal or a sometimes temporary stunning effect.The research team looked at data from 3100 cases of avian window collisions in eight states from 2016 to 2021 to come up with an estimate of how many birds are killed after surviving initial impact. They discovered that 60 percent of birds who were treated still died mostly from brain injuries. They noted that birds commonly  wake up  following impact and fly away seemingly uninjured.When the researchers considered these cases the total number of birds who died from colliding with windows in the U.S. each year rose to roughly one billion.Preventing birds from colliding with windows is as easy as placing stickers or tape to windows and turning off lights at night.

Families use the rivers to access and transport water food fuel and medical supplies. The children also use them to travel to school.Food insecurity caused by the drought has increased malnutrition risk in the region s children while restricted access to drinking water could lead to an increase in infectious diseases. In the Brazilian Amazon more than 760 medical clinics and over 1700 schools have become inaccessible or were forced to close due to low river levels.In addition to essential health child protection and education services being drastically disrupted in the region fishing and agricultural livelihoods have also been interrupted putting lives at risk.

According to a recently released study it resulted in the deaths of roughly four million common murres   one of Alaska s most prominent seabirds   representing a decline of more than half of the state s entire population.The study authors wrote that the heatwave had an enormous effect on key habitat-forming species like corals and kelps which triggered cascading bottom-up harm toward the top of the food chain.Common murres rely on fish as a food source but the fish they normally prey on were largely absent due to the cascading effects of the heatwave making the most likely cause of the die-off a mass-starvation event.Despite having plenty of time the murres  population has not begun to recover but the cause is unclear.

To add to the problem climate change is lowering the nutritional value of certain foods that these plant eaters rely on.Fossil fuel emissions produced by humans are causing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide to rise pushing up temperatures worldwide. This is causing plants to grow faster in ecosystems across the globe research biologist Ellen Welti with the Smithsonian Institution s Great Plains Science Program wrote in The Conversation.Welti said changes in plants  long-term nutritional value could be one underappreciated cause of falling animal populations however more research will be necessary to understand the role of nutrient dilution in the declines of individual species.

According to data from the CAMS Global Fire Assimilation System June wildfire carbon emissions are already the third highest for the month since 2003.The accumulation of wildfire smoke impacts air quality at high latitudes. It also has the potential to cause aerosols in the smoke to deposit onto surfaces like snow and ice reducing their ability to reflect sunlight meaning they absorb more solar energy and are more prone to melting.According to the most recent report from Russian federal organization Avialesookhrana as of June 27 72 active wildfires were burning in the Sakha Republic covering an area of nearly 700000 acres.The region s wildfire activities come after a period of unusually high surface air temperatures in late May with local media reporting forecast temperatures seven to nine degrees Celsius above normal. Copernicus Climate Change Service data confirmed the predictions with warmer surface temperatures and drier soils in the first three quarters of June.As global heating leads to higher temperatures in the Arctic wildfires have shifted north and are burning through tundra and boreal forest which releases enormous stores of greenhouse gases from the carbon-rich soils.

They also looked at sea surface temperature simulations with and without the effects of climate change using climate models and found that the rising temperatures were the result of the human-caused climate crisis.Five of the six warmest years on record coincide with the recent Coral Sea mass bleaching events. The sea experienced the highest temperatures in 400 years in 2017 2020 and 2024 with this year being the warmest by a wide margin. The next warmest three years were in 2004 2016 and 2022.

In total the report reviewed 225 companies and their progress toward plastic-related goals with about half of companies receiving an  F  score.The 2024 Plastic Promises Scorecard has revealed a gap between the plastic waste reduction goals that companies set and the actual actions they are making toward meeting those goals. The report evaluated companies on a total score based on their ambitions and their actions toward goals related to six pillars: recyclability reduction recycled content recovery reusable and extended producer responsibility. Ambitions counted toward 30% of the total score while the actual actions companies were taking made up 70% of the final score.Plastic Promises Scorecard uses a first-of-its-kind scoring system to evaluate not just what companies say they will do to act on the plastics crisis but what they have actually accomplished. The findings showed that most of the companies in the report had targets to incorporate recycled content but the same companies weren t investing in recycling infrastructure to collect old packaging and recycle it. Only nine of the 225 companies had even set goals to create zero-waste packaging that could be reused or recycled indefinitely rather than becoming waste.The latest Plastic Promises Scorecard did show some hope though.

The Antillean manatee has been proposed to be listed as an endangered species.The proposal determined that although Florida manatees face threats from boat strikes algal blooms loss of their food source (seagrasses) and loss of warm-water refuge areas the subspecies still does not meet the criteria to relist Florida manatees as endangered. USFWS stated that it made its latest proposal to maintain the threatened status of Florida manatees while uplisting Antillian manatees as endangered based on the estimate that the Florida manatee s likelihood of extinction in the next 150 years was lower than 1%.However environmentalists have argued that the Florida manatee should be relisted as an endangered species.

Zeldin said the EPA would reconsider the finding over concerns that it had resulted in  an agenda that throttles our industries our mobility and our consumer choice while benefiting adversaries overseas.

But based on an internal memo shared by the group Resistance Rangers which is made up of current and former National Park Service (NPS) workers NPS staff have been told not to share external communications about the record number of visits.The information is publicly available on the NPS Visitation Statistics Dashboard which shared that there were 331.9 million visits to National Parks sites in 2024 up from the previous record of 330971689 set in 2016. This number also increased by 6.36 million visits or 2% compared to visits in 2023.Yet according to the internal memo shared by Resistance Rangers NPS workers were advised that there would be no external communications rollout. The internal memo noted that parks could share the visitor number info on their websites if  that is the park s standard process (e.g. parks that post monthly visitation reports) but should not issue a press release or other proactive communications including social media posts. As the parks reach record-high attendance both Resistance Rangers and NPCA have pointed out that NPS is under threat with recent mass firings and planned NPS office closings.  Link in bio.

The climate crisis refers to the destabilization of the climate conditions that have allowed human communities and current ecosystems to survive and thrive on Earth. It is caused by a rise in global temperatures that scientists conclude is  unequivocally  driven by human activity   primarily the burning of fossil fuels and secondarily the destruction of forests and other natural carbon sinks. Since humans began using fossil fuels in earnest at the start of the industrial revolution global temperatures have risen to 1.1 degrees Celsius above the 1850 to 1900 average. Global heating has now reached a rate of increase of more than 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade. This warming has already led to the melting of Arctic sea ice the retreat of glaciers and more frequent and intense extreme weather events like heat waves foods and droughts. These events have already claimed lives driven species to extinction and forced more than 13 million people from their homes in Africa and Asia in 2019 alone. With every further warming increase the risks of additional harms become ever more severe.  Interest in learning more? Head on over to the link in our bio..

San Francisco officials argued that the EPA s authority had been exceeded due to vague permit rules that made it impossible to tell when a line had been crossed.The justices ruled that generic prohibitions against violations of water quality standards cannot be imposed by the EPA.

Each year approximately a third of worldwide food production goes to waste a press release from UMichigan said. Meanwhile according to the United Nations  Food and Agriculture Organization roughly 800 million people go hungry.According to a recent study by fully refrigerating food supply chains   creating  cold chains    greenhouse gas emissions related to food waste would be reduced by 41 percent globally.Parts of Asia could see a food loss reduction of 45 percent as well as 54 percent lower associated emissions under optimized refrigeration conditions the study said. And food loss in Sub-Saharan Africa could be reduced by 47 percent while their emissions could drop by 66 percent in an optimized refrigeration scenario.The researchers of this study said the actual greenhouse gas emissions reductions would depend on cold-chain technology efficiency as well as the carbon intensity of electrical grids since emissions from refrigeration can be significant.The researchers also found that in many situations the development of less industrialized and more local  farm-to-table  supply chains could result in food savings comparable or even exceeding optimized cold chains. The study compared the benefits of  farm-to-table  food systems with those of technologically advanced and globalized food-supply chains.

However they found that native species are only moving at an average rate of around 1.74 kilometers per year.In general invasive species are spreading 100 times faster than native plants and animals and even some that seem more sedentary are moving at least three times faster than native species. To compare how human actions drove range expansion the researchers analyzed data for 249 native species 242 non-native species and 192 non-native species introduced through human actions.The study revealed that invasive species were moving at a rate of around 35 kilometers per year without human actions.

The sweeping move would have allowed millions of acres to be opened to extractive development activities and taken away the federal subsistence priority for millions of acres.The decision had been put on hold so that these potential impacts could be given full consideration as well as to allow time for engagement with Alaska Native communities and the public.The announcement builds on the current administration s conservation actions for millions of acres of Alaska s lands and waters. These include protecting roughly 2.8 million acres in the Beaufort Sea so that new oil and gas leases are prohibited in the whole of the U.S. Arctic Ocean implementing maximum protections for 13 million-plus acres in Special Areas of the western Arctic and preventing irreversible harms to permafrost and Tribal subsistence.

Emissions from Canadian boreal forest fires were more than nine times above the average for the last two decades contributing nearly a quarter of worldwide emissions.The Canadian wildfires caused more than 230000 people to be evacuated and claimed the lives of eight firefighters. The study s climate models suggested that extreme wildfires will become more intense and frequent by 2100 especially in high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Forecasts for the 2024-25 fire season indicated a continuation of above-average probability of fire weather s dry hot and windy conditions in portions of South and North America with favorable wildfire conditions for June and July in the Brazilian Pantanal British Columbia Alberta and California.

The analysis concluded that the combination of recent reductions in shipping pollution   which have the effect of blocking the sun   and increasing emissions from fossil fuels have been greater than previously thought. Independent experts said that though the results of the study are on the high end of the range of mainstream climate science they cannot be ruled out. If the estimates are correct more extreme weather will happen sooner with a bigger risk that the planet will surpass tipping points like the collapse of crucial Atlantic ocean currents.According to the new analysis without changes the planet will likely warm by about two degrees Celsius by 2045.

The research team looked at warming predictions from 20 climate models and found that this part of the bay would no longer be suitable habitat for the bears at approximately 2.2 degrees Celsius of planetary warming.

Gardens with long grass in highly arable areas had as much as 93 percent more butterflies while urban landscapes saw an increase of 18 percent. The study looked specifically at gardens but the benefits of wild spaces and long grass for butterflies are likely applicable to other green spaces like parks small fruit and vegetable patches the grounds of schools and strips of grass and vegetation between sidewalks and roadways.

The order will be the first elephant cull since 1988.Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Authority (ZimParks) has been tasked with the cull. Fulton Mangwanya director general of ZimParks said that the culling will be prioritized in areas where there have been human-elephant conflicts.According to the ZimParks website Zimbabwe has the second largest population of elephants in the world. Namibia which neighbors Zimbabwe recently ordered a similar cull for over 700 animals including 83 elephants. The decision has brought criticism from both conservationists and those concerned about the cull s impact on tourism. Those in support of elephant culling argue it will not only feed people and reduce pressure on resources but will also control the increasing elephant population and its impact on the environment.As for alternatives to elephant culling World Wildlife Fund has listed several options including translocation conflict mitigation efforts and breeding regulations and contraceptives.

They simulated Antarctica s Thwaites Glacier   called the  Doomsday Glacier  for its accelerating rate of melt and corresponding potential to raise sea levels   retreating and found that even Thwaites was not likely to experience rapid collapse this century.Morlinghem said the study s findings suggested that the physics in the IPCC report were inaccurate as well as the fact that glacial collapse is not simple and does not happen that quickly as predicted by the IPCC. None of the simulations predicted the inland retreat of Thwaites  ice cliffs at the speed suggested by MICI. Instead when the ice sheet was not being held back by the ice shelf the glacier s movement toward the ocean accelerated rapidly causing its ice sheet to expand.

They are relied upon for global heating projections as well as weather forecasting in the United States.Several of the workers who were fired were in charge of crucial projects and it is likely that several GFDL projects   including a new type of atmospheric model   will face delays as will more accurate regional climate predictions.The American Meteorological Society earlier this week warned that the firings  are likely to cause irreparable harm and have far-reaching consequences for public safety economic well-being and the United States  global leadership. Of special concern to GFDL is the latest version of its atmospheric model AM5. The new model is designed to run at higher frequencies and resolutions and allows for the use of long-term climate change code to be used in seasonal weather forecasts.

They serve as #nature preserves cultural beacons and educational #outreach for future #conservationists everywhere. Not to mention they make incredible #vacation spots and #travel destinations  . This week is a celebration of their history and cultural impact so the National Park Service is inviting you to join them! To kick off the celebration   entry is FREE on the 19th at any National Park so let s get exploring!Unfortunately there s something slimy in the water. Even while we celebrate the impact of National Parks the Trump administration has been working to destroy #nationalparks and the #NationalParkService as we know it. They re trying to allow #drilling cut funding and erase #LGBTQ contributions from the history books. But one group is fighting back hard: the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) is sounding the alarm!Over the last 100+ years the Parks have been something Americans can truly be proud of and the #NPCA intends to keep it that way! Founded in 1919 by OG Park Rangers they ve safeguarded the Parks and the National Park Service for over a century. Now they re rallying against the members of the House and Senate to make sure the parks they vowed to protect stay unblemished by government greed. They were literally made for this.   Want to help? Get loud! Make your voices heard! And make sure to visit one of the over 400(!!!) parks across the nation to show your support for these preserved natural spaces!  It is the people who must save their own national parks.  - Robert Sterling Yard co-founder of the NPCA.  editor: brynnerardin #nationalparks #nps #NationalParkWeek #yellowstone #glaciernationalpark #everglades #greatsmokymountains #yosemite #joshuatree #grandcanyon #NPCA #ecology #environment #conservation #ecowatch,it s #nationalparkweek from april 19 to april 27 but our parks are still under attacknational parks are a cornerstone of #america and the american experience they serve as #nature preserves cultural beacons and educational #outreach for future #conservationists everywhere not to mention they make incredible #vacation spots and #travel destinations this week is a celebration of their history and cultural impact so the national park service is inviting you to join them to kick off the celebration entry is free on the 19th at any national park so let s get exploringunfortunately there s something slimy in the water even while we celebrate the impact of national parks the trump administration has been working to destroy #nationalparks and the #nationalparkservice as we know it they re trying to allow #drilling cut funding and erase #lgbtq contributions from the history books but one group is fighting back hard the national parks conservation association npca is sounding the alarmover the last 100 years the parks have been something americans can truly be proud of and the #npca intends to keep it that way founded in 1919 by og park rangers they ve safeguarded the parks and the national park service for over a century now they re rallying against the members of the house and senate to make sure the parks they vowed to protect stay unblemished by government greed they were literally made for this want to help get loud make your voices heard and make sure to visit one of the over 400 parks across the nation to show your support for these preserved natural spaces it is the people who must save their own national parks robert sterling yard cofounder of the npca editor brynnerardin #nationalparks #nps #nationalparkweek #yellowstone #glaciernationalpark #everglades #greatsmokymountains #yosemite #joshuatree #grandcanyon #npca #ecology #environment #conservation #ecowatch

On the other hand solar farms wind turbines and other renewable energy installations offer an option for sustainable land use that directly reduces greenhouse gas emissions.Roughly 0.01 square kilometers of land is required per megawatt (MW) for utility-scale solar farms while wind farms need 0.12 square kilometers for each MW though just a small fraction of the land is impacted by infrastructure and turbines.

Composting is the practice of intentionally breaking down organic substances   like food scraps   and turning it into compost essentially a nutrient-rich organic matter that is excellent for feeding plants. It also helps reduce methane emissions associated with food waste. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council  compost is an essential tool for improving large-scale agricultural systems  by improving soil health reducing erosion and conserving water.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also notes that using compost  attracts beneficial organisms to the soil and reduces the need for pesticides and fertilizers  as well as promotes carbon sequestration and subsequently climate resiliency!

The landslide triggered a 656-foot  mega-tsunami  inside the narrow fjord where it moved back and forth generating vibrations felt by sensors all over the planet. Scientists say landslides like the one in Greenland are happening more often as climate change causes glaciers supporting Greenland s mountains to melt.The signal was traced to eastern Greenland. To locate the exact location the seismologists contacted their Denmark colleagues who had gotten reports of a tsunami generated by a landslide in remote Dickson Fjord.This led to a collaboration between 68 scientists from 15 countries over the course of almost a year. They sifted through satellite seismic and land-based data in addition to tsunami wave simulations to solve the mystery of the unidentified seismic object (USO).The ensuing tsunami wave that became trapped in the narrow fjord created a  seiche  or tightly enclosed wave moving rhythmically back and forth. Scientists had never known a seiche to last such a long time.With the Arctic warming four times faster than other parts of the globe since 1979 this could mean more frequent mega-tsunamis triggered by landslides in the region.

In fact researchers noted that the levels of PFAAs in sea spray aerosols were even higher than in seawater itself and the researchers estimated that emissions of PFAAs from sea spray could be even greater than those in the atmosphere from manufacturing sources and other known polluters  The study looked at PFAAs that are remobilized from seawater into sea spray via field studies of the Atlantic Ocean between the UK and Chile. Researchers Bo Sha and Jana Johansson used a sea spray emulator and worked from a ship for two months according to Sha. They found that PFAA concentrations in the sea spray were over 100000 times greater than the amount of PFAAs in the water itself.PFAS (per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances) are chemical compounds that do not break down in the environment and have been linked to human health risks including elevated risks of certain types of cancer as well as potential environmental impacts as they bioaccumulate in wildlife. PFAAs in particular are common in firefighting foams food packaging and waterproof and stain-repellent materialsAccording to the study authors an estimated 49 tons of PFOA and 26 tons of PFOS are emitted each year from sea spray aerosols compared to an estimated 1 to 1.4 tons of PFOS emitted into the air annually from industrial sources. The amount of PFOA emissions from sea spray is also comparable to the up to 74 tons of PFOA in the atmosphere from various known emitters as of 2012 the authors wrote in the study.The scientists noted that these findings raise health concerns for people in coastal regions. They also suggested that their estimates in the study could fall short of the actual amount of PFAAs moving through to coastal regions.  Link in bio.

That s a 3.6 percent drop and the lowest level since 1872.The country s coal use was also the lowest it s been since the mid-1600s.While UK emissions are currently 54 percent below 1990 levels the country s gross domestic product has increased by 84 percent.Some of the major contributors to the reduction in coal use were the closure of the country s last coal-fired power plant in Nottinghamshire as well as Wales  Port Talbot steelworks one of the UK s last blast furnaces. An almost 40 percent increase in electric vehicles (EV) on UK roads was another contributing factor along with above-average temperatures and electricity in the UK being the  cleanest ever  last year.To reach its 2035 climate goal as well as its target of net-zero by 2050 the UK s emissions would need to be cut more each year than they were in 2024.

They move tons of deep-water nutrients to the surface when they poop and according to new research they also transport massive amounts of nutrients from Alaska to Hawaii in their urine.Fifteen years ago scientists discovered that whale poop provided a crucial resource for the growth of plankton contributing to ocean productivity a press release from the University of Vermont (UVM) said.Now a new UVM-led study has found that whales carry large amounts of nutrients across entire ocean basins   from the cold waters of their feeding grounds to the warm seas where they mate and birth their calves near the equator. Most of the nutrients are transported through their urine with carcasses sloughed skin placentas and calf feces also contributing.The researchers calculated that throughout the world s oceans great whales   including gray whales humpbacks and right whales   move roughly 4000 tons of nitrogen annually to tropical and subtropical low-nutrient coastal areas.These massive whales also bring over 45000 tons of biomass. Before whaling by humans decimated whale populations at least three times more nutrients might have been transported these incredible distances.

The 38-day survey uncovered and recorded more than 2000 species of plants and wildlife.The expedition was led by a team of researchers from Conservation International who were joined by Indigenous scientists and guides from Global Earth as well as local experts from the Indigenous Regional Federation of the Alto Mayo Awajun Communities.Of the 2000 species they recorded 27 were new to science and nearly 50 are threatened with extinction. Four of the newly discovered species were mammals.The purpose of the expedition was to find the greatest number of species in a short time. The setting for this unique search was unusual however since the area has been scarred by deforestation and is full of human settlements rather than being the kind of  pristine  forest setting where an abundance of rare wildlife would be found.The expedition was the beginning of a plan to connect Alto Mayo s remaining patches of abundant biodiversity to create a conservation corridor for the long-term protection of the region s wildlife.

The 54 researchers from seven countries deployed thousands of instruments to collect ocean data both at the surface and up to 2000 meters below the surface   the latter called ocean heat content   covering all the world s oceans. The researchers found that all three major metrics they analyzed broke records this year: global sea surface temperature average global sea surface temperature and the temperature of water up to 2000 meters below the surface. From 2023 to 2024 the researchers recorded an enormous increase of the upper 2000 meters of ocean heat content of 16 zettajoules. That increase represents about 140 times the world s total energy production in 2023.Ocean temperatures are a critical indicator of human-caused climate change. The vast majority   about 90%   of the Earth s excess heat from global warming is stored in the oceans. Warming oceans also tend to lead to more and more intense storms. The team plans to continue keeping track of ocean warming going forward.  Link in bio.  Michael Riojas.Sunset on a beach in Cadiz Spain on July 23 2024.

The first reports of spinning fish came in fall 2023 with smalltooth sawfish deaths beginning in January. Scientists including those at the Florida Fish and Wildfire Conservation Commission (FWC) quickly responded and were able to rule out red tide and dissolved oxygen issues as the cause of this outbreak. FWC took samples from more than 300 fish and conducted necropsies have been on 32 of the 45 dead sawfish. Right now everything is pointing to what is likely a naturally occurring species or multiple species of algae that produce low levels of toxins. These are neurotoxins that would be consistent with the behavioral changes observed. Gil McRae director of the commission s Fish and Wildlife Research Institute said that a recent decrease in incidents of spinning fish could be a sign that  we re on the tail end of this event.  But the official cause of the erratic behavior remains unclear. : brynnerardin.#ecowatchers #climatenews #climatechange #globalwarming  #florida #floridakeys #sawfish #fish #ocean #algae #endangered,have you heard of the spinning fish phenomenon happening in florida the first reports of spinning fish came in fall 2023 with smalltooth sawfish deaths beginning in january scientists including those at the florida fish and wildfire conservation commission fwc quickly responded and were able to rule out red tide and dissolved oxygen issues as the cause of this outbreak fwc took samples from more than 300 fish and conducted necropsies have been on 32 of the 45 dead sawfish right now everything is pointing to what is likely a naturally occurring species or multiple species of algae that produce low levels of toxins these are neurotoxins that would be consistent with the behavioral changes observed gil mcrae director of the commission s fish and wildlife research institute said that a recent decrease in incidents of spinning fish could be a sign that we re on the tail end of this event but the official cause of the erratic behavior remains unclear brynnerardin#ecowatchers #climatenews #climatechange #globalwarming #florida #floridakeys #sawfish #fish #ocean #algae #endangered

This marked the second consecutive year of declining deforestation numbers.However over 36379 square kilometers of the rainforest were degraded last year compared to the 6092 square kilometers affected by land degradation in 2023. Degradation in 2024 was the highest since 2009 Imazon reported.Forest fires were a major contributor to land degradation according to Imazon. The Rainforest Foundation reported that 2024 had the highest number of fires in the Brazilian Amazon since 2005 burning an area of land larger than the state of California. Experts expect some relief from fires over the winter when higher rainfall will keep degradation from wildfires at bay. But they also emphasize a need for more conservation areas to reduce other degradation factors such as logging.  Link in bio.

Beyond the additions in China new capacity coming online in India Indonesia Vietnam Pakistan Japan Bangladesh South Korea Zimbabwe and Greece drove the increase.According to Global Coal Plant Tracker data 69.5 gigawatts (GW) of coal capacity were commissioned in 2023 while 21.1 GW were retired   a net yearly increase of 48.4 GW and a total capacity worldwide of 2130 GW.Outside of China a total of 22.1 GW were commissioned with 17.4 GW retired   a net increase of 4.7 GW. Since the 2015 Paris Agreement 25 countries have reduced their coal-fired capacity while 35 have increased it.Last year marked the lowest retirement of coal capacity of any year in over a decade.Lower coal plant retirements last year in Europe and the United States contributed to the uptick in operating capacity. Nearly half of retirements in 2023 were in the U.S.   9.7 GW   down from the country s record high of 21.7 GW in 2015.While most global coal operating capacity is currently under some sort of net zero or similar pledge 1626 GW   75 percent   continues to be without a closure commitment.

A new report has found that per unit carbon dioxide emissions have fallen by over two-thirds in a decade within the UK. The analysis attributed this to the phasing out of coal in the UK which now generates less than half the amount of electricity from fossil fuels than it did a decade ago. Meanwhile the generation of power from renewable sources has more than doubled.Fossil fuels made up 29 percent of electricity generation in the UK last year   the lowest level ever recorded   with renewables accounting for a record 45 percent nuclear and biomass each generating roughly 13 percent imports 11 percent and solar producing four percent.This resulted in each unit of electricity generating an average of 124 grams of carbon compared with 419 grams of  carbon intensity  for each kilowatt hour in 2014.The analysis said wind was  expected to form the backbone of the nation s electricity system by 2030 . The Labour government has pledged to decarbonize electricity in the UK by then with ambitious plans to ramp up solar and wind.

Scientists have studied the nutritional profiles of 57 varieties of pollen and discovered that in order to have a balanced diet of essential amino and fatty acids bees must forage from a wide array of plants.The world s agricultural systems are dependent on bees as essential pollinators. At the same time bees and plants are interdependent   bees need pollen from plants for sustenance and many plants reproduce by bees spreading their pollen. Nectar provides bees with carbohydrates while pollen gives them critical nutrients like proteins and lipids. Human-caused environmental changes that alter pollen s natural properties and availability risk causing malnourishment in bees.Bees need high-quality foods that contain fatty acids like omega-3 and omega-6 that are non-esterified. Without them bees don t live as long are less able to deal with environmental stressors and have weaker immune systems. Consuming nutrients in the wrong ratio can lead to cognitive issues. Amino acids are necessary for reproduction and cognitive health in bees but eating too many of them can make them more susceptible to some parasites.Results from the scientific study indicated that foraging for food from a wide variety of flowers is healthiest for most bees and that endemic plant species offer no nutritional advantage over non-native plants. Most pollen species provide the majority of needed nutrients but for optimal dietary needs bees need to visit several different plant species.

Now new research finds that warming will disrupt many of Earth s major crops and harm global crop diversity.The study conducted by researchers at Aalto University in Finland analyzed 30 of the world s most important crops and modeled how climate change is likely to affect their safe climatic space under different potential global warming scenarios.The researchers found that crops growing at lower latitudes or closer to the equator will be hardest hit as those areas continue to get hotter and more arid.For each of the 30 crops the researchers established their  safe climatic space  which can be likened to a Goldilocks zone of optimal growth using average precipitation aridity and temperature. As warming increases the researchers found the safe climatic space for crops tends to move farther and farther away from the equator and if warming goes beyond 1.5 degrees it could threaten  up to half  of the world s crops at lower latitudes.

As time goes on this kind of unsustainable use leads to depleted rivers lakes aquifers groundwater and other natural water reserves.Sangiorgio and Rosa quantified water gaps for scenarios under baseline 1.5 and 3 degrees Celsius of warming accounting for factors such as surface and groundwater depletion and water requirements for aquatic ecosystems.The findings showed that there are already almost 458 billion cubic meters in water gaps annually. They are predicted to grow by 6% under a 1.5 degrees Celsius warming scenario and by 15% if the planet warms by 3 degrees Celsius.

As a reason for imposing the tariffs Trump cited a national emergency related to undocumented immigrants coming into the U.S. as well as the flow of the drug fentanyl into the country reported CNN. Trump has said he will use the tariffs to raise revenue bring other nations to the negotiating table and balance trade.But economists have warned the tariffs would have a negative impact on U.S. consumers and businesses.

The report A Threat to Progress: Confronting the effects of climate change on child health and well-being found that 466 million children   one in five children in the world   are exposed to this unprecedented level of excessive heat.The researchers compared average temperatures in the 1960s to those from 2020 to 2024   with extremely hot days being those that were more than 95 degrees Fahrenheit   and found that they had increased for nearly half a billion children around the world many of whom did not have the services or infrastructure to cope.The analysis looked at data by country and found that in 16 nations children today are subjected to an additional month-plus of extremely hot days in comparison with six decades ago. Excessive heat stress can contribute to non-communicable diseases like heat-related illnesses malnutrition in children and can make children more susceptible to infectious diseases like malaria and dengue that spread easily in high temperatures. Extreme heat also impacts mental health neurodevelopment and overall wellbeing.When extreme heat goes on for longer periods its effects are compounded. Children in more than half of the 100 countries surveyed were found to experience twice the number of heat waves now than 60 years ago and these extremely hot temperatures are increasing in every country around the world.

Heavy metal toxins from industrial production chemicals from the agriculture sector untreated wastewater plastic pollution crude oil leaks and spills toxins from the increasing wildfires and other pollutants need systems-level change. However natural processes in the environment do offer solutions.Bioremediation is a process by which plants and microbes that are already present in the environment   like fungi algae and bacteria   have the power to remove or reduce environmental pollution   even plastic pollution. While natural bioremediation has been around since the dawn of time (microbes were the earliest known life forms) modern bioremediation offers techniques that stimulate and augment these processes. While there are numerous bioremediation types there are also several processes that have been utilized and are either done in situ (at the place of contamination) or ex situ (off-site of the contamination).Head on over to the link in our bio to learn more! .

This prevents bison from sharing the same spaces as humans. By installing pedestrian bridges the bison can have a greater range while the humans can watch and learn more about these creatures.With the bridges the bison will expand their roaming area from 50 hectares to around 200 hectares. Currently the bison are restricted to fenced regions because of the official dangerous wildlife designation.While the bridges help expand the range for the bison conservationists are hoping to push UK officials to update rewilding laws to allow for bison preservation and expansion projects that won t require expensive steel fencing.Two of the bridges are expected to be complete before the end of 2024.

Climate fiction is a genre of fiction that emerged in the first decades of the 21st century in response to growing awareness of the climate crisis caused primarily by the burning of fossil fuels. As the term  cli-fi  suggests climate fiction was originally highly associated with science fiction and often features scientist protagonists or the latest climate science to offer imaginings or warnings of what the near or far future might look like if humans do or do not act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However as the impacts of climate change have intruded ever more into daily life the genre has evolved to include many works set in the present or near-present as well. Climate fiction is a diverse gathering of works that ranges from Hollywood disaster thrillers like The Day After Tomorrow to hard science fiction focused on technological and political change such as the works of Kim Stanley Robinson to introspective literary novels like Jenny Offill s Weather. Many writers and critics who engage with climate fiction see it as a way to alter our climate reality by offering a warning of a future to avoid or providing a roadmap toward a more just and sustainable society. Some argue that because people have a hard time empathizing with their future selves reading about and caring for characters contending with the climate crisis can help them make that imaginative leap and take action today.

Some cities have seen a total change in their climate moving from typically dry regions to regions prone to flooding and vice versa according to the study.The report conducted by non-governmental organization WaterAid in collaboration with researchers from the University of Bristol and Cardiff University investigated the climate trends in the 100 most-populated cities globally as well as 12 cities where the NGO operates. In total 95% of the observed cities were experiencing a shift toward wetter or dryer climates. According to the findings 15% of the cities are experiencing climate  whiplash  where they face periods of drought almost immediately followed by flooding. The recent wildfires in Los Angeles were an example of such whiplash with wetter periods both before and after the fires. The rainy period increased vegetation growth which fueled larger fires. Now after the fires some people in Southern California are being evacuated amid wetter weather because of increased mudslide risks.The cities facing varying climate extremes face risk of infrastructure that cannot keep up with the shifts in wet or dry weather events.

The marine species who live in this unique environment burrow into the sediment and process food in a variety of ways that determine their levels of plastic exposure. The research team found that seabed creatures living in parts of the ocean with high plastic pollution levels   particularly the Mediterranean and Yellow Seas   had ingested the most plastics.In 93 percent of studies microplastics were found in animals living on the seafloor.The researchers found that predators seabed scavengers called deposit feeders   as opposed to filter feeders   and omnivores were the most likely to take plastic into their bodies. Especially susceptible were marine animals like crabs as well as starfish sea urchins brittlestars sea cucumbers and squid.The findings of the study will assist scientists and policymakers with filling in knowledge gaps and focusing their actions as details of the Global Plastics Treaty are finalized  Link in bio.  cristenhemingwayjaynes.A sea urchin using electrician s tape as camouflage.

It was the second lowest on record since the count started in 1997.The count represents a steep decline from the more than 200000 overwintering Western monarchs observed during each of the past three years. The all-time low was fewer than 2000 recorded in 2020.The low number coincides with the proposed protection of monarchs under the U.S. Endangered Species Act by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).Since the 1980s the Western population of monarchs has declined by over 95 percent reported the Los Angeles Times. Back then it was estimated that as many as four million butterflies spent the winter in California. Unless urgent conservation efforts are taken FWS says Western monarchs face a 99 percent chance of becoming extinct by 2080.

They used chemical analysis of bowhead whales that had been killed to demonstrate that they are able to live more than two centuries. The chemical evidence was corroborated by harpoon tips from the 19th century being recovered from bowheads killed during modern hunts.Additionally the team looked at four decades of data that had been collected through photo identification programs tracking critically endangered North Atlantic right whales   who live along North America s Atlantic coast   and Southern right whales found south of the equator. Their analysis showed that Southern right whales can live longer than 130 years   with some possibly living to 150 years   rather than the 70 to 80 years that had been previously thought.

The studies took place in Hong Kong Australia Vietnam the U.S. South Korea Portugal and Japan.According to the analysis green spaces showed to improve health for residents of urban areas and these green spaces were particularly beneficial to vulnerable populations including elderly adults and children.Studies in Australia and Japan revealed that adding more vegetation to urban spaces could reduce heat including by 0.5 to 2 degrees Celsius in Melbourne Central Business District specifically as well as reduce mortality rates related to heat stress. Further the analysis determined that urban green spaces could reduce heat-related diseases and deaths as well as provide economic value.The authors of the study have recommended that officials consider expanding access to public cooling and hydration centers to mitigate heat-related deaths.

Much of these cost savings are made possible through China s rapid clean energy technology manufacturing capacity. According to the report China can produce a megawatt-hour of clean energy at 11% to 64% lower costs than other markets.The current U.S. administration may soon move forward with tariffs on Mexico and Canada which could also impact electricity prices and nuclear energy production in the U.S.But despite these trade barriers the report had a positive outlook for clean energy prices globally. Already battery storage costs globally fell by one-third in 2024 and fixed-axis solar farm rates decreased 21%. Battery storage is expected to fall further from a benchmark of $104 per megawatt-hour to below $100 per megawatt-hour and solar and wind energy generation is expected to decreased by 2% to 4%.

As explained in the study  Once conversion to a specific metal chloride is achieved that compound distills from the mixture in seconds. This allows both thermodynamic and kinetic selectivity for desired metals with minimization of impurities. This process allowed the researchers to collect multiple different metals including tantalum sourced from capacitors gallium from diodes and indium from old solar conductive film. Not only were the researchers able to extract these valuable metals from old electronic parts but they also had a yield of more than 85% and metal purity levels of more than 95%.  Link in bio.

According to a 2024 report from the United Nations Environment Program households throughout the world wasted an average of more than one billion meals per day in 2022. Meanwhile 783 million people were impacted by hunger and one-third faced food insecurity.When we waste food we also waste valuable resources. When we throw away food we re also throwing away the land water and energy used to produce that food  said Pete Pearson vice president of food loss and waste at WWF.Pearson suggested taking measures to avoid throwing good food away this holiday season by preparing  just enough  food for your guests.

For scale that s more than the weight of two humpback whales or three full-sized school buses!Established in 2018 Goal: Clean Seas Florida Keys is a community-led partnership between Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary the Foundation and local dive operators to remove underwater marine debris from the waters of the Keys and engage and educate the public about its role in marine debris prevention. Cortney Benson Marine Debris Removal Stewardship Coordinator at the National Marine Sanctuary Foundation said  I am beyond proud of the Blue Star Dive Operators and both the professional and recreational divers for accomplishing this monumental feat. This work makes a difference not only for the reefs and biodiversity under the water but for the recreation economy of the Keys which rely on thriving sanctuary ecosystems.  Marine debris is one of the greatest challenges facing our global ocean. It threatens marine wildlife and sensitive habitats and can create safety and navigational hazards for recreation tourism and fishing and pose risks to animals through ingestion or entanglement.#ecowatchers #climatenews #climatechange #globalwarming #ocean #oceanconservation #florida #floridakeys #marinedebris,the national marine sanctuary foundation marinesanctuaryfdn recently announced a milestone with the removal of 100000 pounds of marine debris from noaa s florida keys national marine sanctuary through the goal clean seas florida keys program for scale that s more than the weight of two humpback whales or three fullsized school busesestablished in 2018 goal clean seas florida keys is a communityled partnership between florida keys national marine sanctuary the foundation and local dive operators to remove underwater marine debris from the waters of the keys and engage and educate the public about its role in marine debris prevention cortney benson marine debris removal stewardship coordinator at the national marine sanctuary foundation said i am beyond proud of the blue star dive operators and both the professional and recreational divers for accomplishing this monumental feat this work makes a difference not only for the reefs and biodiversity under the water but for the recreation economy of the keys which rely on thriving sanctuary ecosystems marine debris is one of the greatest challenges facing our global ocean it threatens marine wildlife and sensitive habitats and can create safety and navigational hazards for recreation tourism and fishing and pose risks to animals through ingestion or entanglement#ecowatchers #climatenews #climatechange #globalwarming #ocean #oceanconservation #florida #floridakeys #marinedebris
Posts_ecowatch_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_d967_CLEANED_193.jpeg,Researchers have determined multiple ways that harvested fog could help meet water demand in arid cities particularly those within the driest area on Earth the Atacama Desert. From providing drinking water to irrigating landscapes to supporting hydroponic gardening the new research shows promise in fog-harvesting technology.In the study published in Frontiers in Environmental Science scientists investigated the potential of fog collection in Alto Hospicio Chile an area threatened by water scarcity. The region receives less than 0.19 inches or 5 millimeters of rain per year. Further the Alto Hospicio region relies on underground aquifers for drinking water and those aquifers have not been replenished in 10000 to 17000 years.While fog harvesting for water has been considered previously the study authors noted that this method is typically considered for rural areas. However the scientists found that fog harvesting could also supplement the water supply in larger urban areas.Researchers used Standard Fog Collectors (SFC) originally described in a 1994 study to capture fog and measure the water harvested from it. They found that they could harvest an average of about 0.2 to 4.9 liters of water from fog per square meter per day within a total area spanning 100 square kilometers.These insights allowed the researchers to explore potential use cases for this water especially if governments place the SFCs in areas with higher fog potential. However the authors wrote that the fog water quality will be dependent on air quality so testing will be important in evaluating the potability of the harvested water. Further cities would need to invest in infrastructure to collect store and distribute the collected water.   Link in bio.

Further the report found that all 14 of the major automotive manufacturers were meeting the light-duty greenhouse gas program requirements set by the EPA for the MY 2023 vehicles. The program requires MY 2023 through MY 2026 vehicles to prioritize vehicle technology that reduces pollution and emissions. According to the EPA the light-duty greenhouse gas program could save more than 3 billion tons of emissions by 2050.The reduction in carbon emissions has also been accompanied by an increase in vehicle fuel economy which has risen 40% since MY 2004. For MY 2023 vehicles alone new vehicle fuel economy reached a record high of 27.1 miles per gallon.   Link in bio.

When you think of agriculture the first images that come to mind might include big red barns full of hay a flock of fuzzy sheep or an orchard of apple trees. But agriculture isn t just all the flora fauna and equipment that puts land-based food to our plates. It can also include everything we hunt and consume under the sea.Aquaculture is a subsector within the agriculture industry. Humans working in this field cultivate or farm livestocks of aquatic species   anything from sea urchins crabs and kelp to salmon and tuna  for consumption. Around 580 aquatic species are harvested through aquaculture methods. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) global aquaculture production in 2020 included 87.5 million tonnes of aquatic animals that mainly went toward human consumption and 35.1 million tonnes of algae including seaweed for  food and non-food uses.

And what it says can be used to educate and improve environmental well-being.The  croaks purrs and grunts  of a thriving coral reef and the  underground rave concert of bubbles and clicks  of healthy soil have both been recorded by scientists to boost ecosystem health.Now in a new piece premiering at the Durham Book Festival in England the  cavernous  effects of a coal mine and the  sound of carbon  are being presented alongside music played by colliery bands and interviews with former coal miners and their families.The recording was made in a Beamish Museum mine shaft. It involved projecting various sound waves into the cave-like space and recording the reverberations. Plans are in the works for an exhibition of the project and a vinyl record release embedded with coal dust.

The automaker said factors like delayed charging infrastructure rollout and the removal of consumer incentives had changed the EV business climate.Volvo expects a combination of full EVs and hybrids to make up from 50 to 60 percent of its sales by 2025. An earlier target of the company was for a minimum of half of their vehicles to be fully electric by next year with the remainder being made up of hybrid models.
