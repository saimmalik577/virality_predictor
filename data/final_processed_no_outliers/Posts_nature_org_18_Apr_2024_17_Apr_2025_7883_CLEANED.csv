What dives deeper than a submarine swims across oceans is covered in polka-dots and has a mouth straight out of a horror movie?  Swipe to find the answer. Well wait... Those teeth!  Leatherback sea turtles are one of natures deep-diving superstars and can stay submerged for around 90 minutes on a single breath. But lets talk about their TEETH!! Take a peak down a leatherback s throat and youll be greeted with a scene straight out of a horror movie. Their esophagus is coated with backward-curved spines called esophageal papillae. Leatherback turtles swallow a lot of seawater as they chomp down on jellyfish and the pallipae help hold their prey in place as the turtles expel that extra seawater back out of their mouths.

It s time to celebrate! The U.S. Foundation for International Conservation Act was just passed by Congress.   TNC has been championing this bill for over a year. Here s why it s a big deal.  It will invest up to $100 million in public funding a year to accelerate conservation efforts in wildlife rich yet vulnerable parts of the world.  The funding will support Indigenous Peoples and local communities helping them better manage their conserved and protected areas.  It will boost U.S. national security and promote regional stability worldwide because political stability depends on the stability to the natural world.So yeah it s a huge win for people and the planet!Learn more with the link in our bio! :1.

The Guam kingfisher native to the island of Guam became extinct in the wild in 1988 following the introduction of the invasive brown snake. For decades the species has survived only in conservation zoos and other wildlife facilities. But this summer nine Guam kingfishers were relocated to The Nature Conservancy s Palmyra Atoll Preserve within the Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge where they are being rewilded. They re not  home  yet but this marks a hopeful new step for their eventual return to their native landscape. Head to the link in our bio to learn more about this remarkable species and their road to recovery.,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/10/nature_org_18010349201450773.jpeg,0.48637,2024-10-25 14:01:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_nature_org_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_7883_CLEANED_9.jpeg

Nature s diversity is our lifeline. From the food on our plates to the air we breathe and the stability of our climate everything relies on the rich tapestry of life on Earth. Yet biodiversity loss is accelerating rapidly primarily due to human activities.We must act swiftly to address the root causes of biodiversity loss by:  Drastically lowering carbon emissions  Protecting diverse habitats at a grand scale  Committing to methods of food production that help nature regenerateIf we can work with nature and not against it natural systems and the life-giving services they provide can bounce back too. By taking on the interconnected crises of climate change and biodiversity loss we aren t merely removing problems and returning to business as usual. We are creating a sustainable future where both people and nature can thrive.Learn more about biodiversity and how you can take action with the link in our bio. :1. Christian Ziegler2.

What do food air climate economies and civilization itself have in common? Biodiversity. It s the variety of life on Earth a rich fabric woven by millions of species and their interactions. It s your connection to everything living or that s ever lived on this planet. Biodiversity makes our lives possible by making Earth habitable. But its value extends far beyond tangible benefits to humankind.  It makes the world more colorful interesting and thought-provoking   It humbles us and leaves us in awe  It enriches us culturally and spiritually by connecting us to something much greater than ourselvesThe time to act is now.

Winter poses unique challenges for wildlife and climate change is making it even tougher. Scientists at TNC have spent 10 years identifying climate-resilient landscapes across the U.S. to help animals adapt. Here are a few ways climate change is affecting winter wildlife:  Canada lynx built for snowy terrain with their big furry paws struggle to adapt as winters warm retreating to higher elevations and becoming more isolated.  Ermine and snowshoe hares change color with the seasons but shorter winters mean their white coats stand out in a snowless landscape making them easy prey.  Hibernation is crucial for many animals but unpredictable temperatures can cause them to wake up too early leaving them unprepared for sudden cold periods.Efforts are being made to maintain connections between habitat areas ensuring wildlife can find suitable conditions even as the climate shifts.

Happy Arbor Day! Today we celebrate and recognize the invaluable role that trees play in our lives and environment. They are the silent heroes working to keep this planet healthy. As part of our commitment we re championing reforestation efforts to combat the connected crises of climate change and biodiversity loss.As if these climate heroes couldn t get any better here are some interesting facts: In big storms a mature tree can soak up and store 50 to 100 gallons of rainwater reducing flooding. A walk in a forest will measurably lower a person s stress hormones blood pressure and heart rate.  A single large tree can pump over a ton of water vapor into the sky in a day. 200 large trees can create a raincloud.  Over the course of 50 years a single tree can provide $62000 worth of air pollution control.  An acre of trees provides enough oxygen for 18 people to breathe each year.Feeling inspired to plant some trees this #arborday? Click the link in our bio to join us in planting a billion trees.  :1.

Africas biodiversity is unmatched with unique life forms that evolved on the continent. Some species are endemic while others have diversified into a multitude of forms each playing a crucial role in their ecosystems. Here are just a few examples of the amazing animals in Africa:African Bush Elephant: These giants roam the savannas and deserts of sub-Saharan Africa and can live up to 70 years- longer than any other mammal except humans.Lemur: Native to Madagascar lemurs are vital to the islands ecosystem aiding in plant pollination and seed dispersal. Unfortunately nearly all lemur species are endangered with about one-third critically endangered.Blue Whale: Once nearly extinct due to commercial whaling blue whales now have a population of 5000-15000. Recently theyve been spotted around the Seychelles a former whaling hotspot thanks to increased marine protection efforts.These fascinating creatures are just a glimpse of Africas rich wildlife.

Florida panther friend or foe? If youre a farmer dealing with feral pigs panthers are an unlikely ally.Invasive hogs are best managed naturally by their predators but with only around 200 panthers left in Florida due to rapid development and road expansion their numbers are dwindling. The U.S. Farm Bill was a win-win for farmer George Winslow helping him place a conservation easement on his citrus farm. This not only protects his land from future development but also creates a wildlife corridor linking panther breeding grounds and habitats.Florida panthers rely on this network of protected lands to hunt and breed using these areas as safe pathways and sources of food and water. This partnership between landowners governments and nature symbolizes the collaboration needed to protect our lands and waters. :1. Mark Conlin courtesy of Tallahassee Natural History Museum2-5.

Sneak PeekThe bright citron body of the gold dust day gecko is designed to blend into the tropical vegetation of its native Madagascar. Though the reptile can also be found in Florida Hawai i and other Pacific islands you may have spotted one closer to home on your television screen as the British accented mascot for an insurance company. In the wild the gecko is less cheerful than its animated counterpart: Males can be aggressive and may rumble when territory is in question.

Good nature news: A tiny fish is making a big recovery in Minnesota! The endangered Topeka shiner is thriving in restored ponds across the tallgrass prairie in southwestern Minnesota including on land protected by The Nature Conservancy in Minnesota (nature_mn).That s because more than 100 restored ponds are providing these minnows with much needed habitat where they can evade predators and breed. And the benefits go beyond a win for a little fish. An entire prairie aquatic community benefits from the restored oxbows and landowners benefit from having a restored oxbow on their land it s a reliable water source that reduces erosion on the land.

Today is World Wetalnds day and were exploring what makes a wetland a wetland? Find out from these TNC land stewards. Brown s Lake Bog Preserve in Ohio (nature_oh) is characterized by a floating sphagnum (peat moss) mat. The naturally acidic properties of sphagnum coupled with its ability to insulate the water below from rapid air temperature changes provide the right environment for creating the bog and its relict boreal plant communities.At the Jacobson Fen in South Dakota mineral-rich water flowing through the region intersects with the surface of the ground creating the unique characteristics of a fen. There are ten fens occurring at the preserve and each one produces a unique and complex habitat. The Clive Runnells Family Mad Island Marsh Preserve in Texas (nature_tx) is made up of coastal prairie freshwater wetlands and salt marshes. The landscape is dotted with slow-draining natural depressions providing ephemeral wetlands for a rich variety of wildlife species. Explore more wetlands protected by TNC with the link in our bio!

You re walking along a riverside path when you hear a splash in the water. Expecting to see a jumping fish you instead spot a furry creature paddling along. As it gets closer to shore you wonder is it a beaver? An otter? Or something else? These animals can be tricky to tell apart but there are a few characteristics that can help you identify some common freshwater mammals:American Mink: These weasel-like creatures have a slender streamlined body and a furred tail. They are active predators and can often be seen running along stream banks while hunting.River Otters: These curious critters are considerably larger than minks reaching several feet in length. They have roundish almost dog-like faces and longer flat tails.Beavers: Look for their flattened large paddle-shaped tail. Beavers have a round build and are quite large with adult males weighing 50 pounds or more!Muskrats: Often mistaken for small beavers muskrats have a rat like furless tail. They weigh 3 to 4 pounds at most and have a round fur ball build. : 1. Tony Norton/TNC Photo Contest 20192. Mark Conlin 3. Kent Mason4.

For nature lovers who want to see scenes straight out of a documentary in real life here s an idea to try   follow the prey.     Though cute bunnies and teeny mice may not seem that exciting they often lead to larger species. Here are 4 tips for viewing unique wildlife interactions: 1  Look for abundance. If there s lots of prey around guess where the predators will be? Exactly. Find a vole-filled field or frog-rich pond on your next hike. 2  Follow the birds. Find a flock of birds and watch their behavior carefully. You should also listen to their audio cues. 3  What s the fuss about? Chirping squirrels screeching birds   if prey is making a lot of noise that could mean a predator is in the area. 4  Observe body language. Pay attention to the movements of the prey. If they look like they re on high alert stick around to find the culprit. Being present in nature is your best bet to witness some nature-documentary-esque animal behavior. Don t forget to be aware of your surroundings and respect the space of wildlife big and small.  : Bear: David Swindler/TNC Photo Contest 2022 Fox:  Marci Lanois/TNC Photo Contest 2022 Mountain Lion: Robert McRae/TNC Photo Contest 2019 Owl: Christine Haines/TNC Photo Contest 2021 Eagle and fox: Zifeng Chen/TNC Photo Contest 2022,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/09/nature_org_18059364238661653.jpeg,0.22354,2024-09-06 17:01:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_nature_org_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_7883_CLEANED_85.jpeg

Bats play a crucial role in pollinating plants and dispersing seeds helping to maintain healthy ecosystems.  They can soar at speeds up to 60 mph and live more than 30 years.  Bats typically have just one pup per year.  A single bat can devour up to 1000 mosquitoes in an hour.  Many bat species in the US are in severe decline or endangered.Let s give a shoutout to our nocturnal friends and spread awareness about their conservation!  : Karine Aigner (kaigner)[Image description: Mexican free-tailed bat emergence in red light at Bracken Bat Cave San Antonio Texas. TNC and batconservationinternational rallied support from politicians and the people of Texas to convince developers not to build houses near Bracken Cave.

HELP FOR KELP   Everyone knows about terrestrial forests but did you know that there are floating forests hiding beneath ocean waves?    Since the 1970s the ethereal and species-rich kelp forests of Tasmania and Southern Australia have been in serious decline due to climate change and habitat degradation only about 5% of historical canopy coverage remains in Tasmania.   But a new collaboration between The Nature Conservancy Google and other partners is using AI-generated maps to reveal the current state of the giant kelp canopy indicate where to collect samples for a biobank that will preserve the species  genetic diversity and direct restoration efforts.     Meanwhile biologists are growing giant kelp in labs and last year seeded the fastgrowing species at 16 study sites in preparation to ramp up outplanting efforts. Help for kelp is on the way!

Reach for the Stars  BIG news! A landmark agreement will protect New Yorks historic Follensby Pond. In 1858 essayist and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson attended a  Philosophers  Camp  at Follensby Pond in upstate New York s Adirondack Mountains initiating discussions that sparked the modern conservation movement. Now 14600 acres including the pond and forest will be protected in perpetuity through an agreement by The Nature Conservancy and New York State. One of the conservation easements establishes a freshwater research preserve to study the pond among the most climate-resilient trout lakes in the Northeast due to its depth and the surrounding forest. It also ensures Indigenous Nations can access their ancestral lands for ceremonies and gathering.Traditional knowledge of the human-nature connection long predates the Philosophers  conversations says TNC s Adirondack Director Peg Olsen. By linking traditional ecological knowledge with Western research on climate resilience she adds  we can create a new story for Follensby going forward.   placidtimesphotography,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/08/nature_org_17990175461688975.jpeg,0.18656,2024-08-14 17:00:00,IMAGE,Posts_nature_org_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_7883_CLEANED_114.jpeg

Birds and Bees Known for its radiant plumage and aerial agility--it can snatch flying insects out of mid-air--the Asian green bee-eater is found in woodlands grasslands and wetlands throughout South Asia and the Middle East. When this skilled hunter uses its beak to snag prey it will bang the insect (it doesnt eat just bees) against its perch to dislodge a stinger before partaking. Farmers across its range have been known to set up perches to encouarge these brids to provide pest control for their fields.

TIP OFFA  shiver  of blacktip reef sharks laze in an Indian Ocean lagoon.Starting in the late 1900s countries around the world began prohibiting shark  finning  the practice of catching sharks slicing off their fins and dumping their (often still living) bodies back in the water. The fins were dried and sold to make soup. Despite a tenfold increase in protective regulations since 2000 a global analysis of shark mortality from fishing finds that these efforts have not been enough to curb the exploitation of sharks. The unsustainable fishing of sharks is a global problem of staggering proportions  says Darcy Bradley a lead ocean scientist for The Nature Conservancy in California. She co-authored the study published in Science which finds shark mortality increased from 76 million to 80 million sharks per year between 2012 and 2019 with more than 30% of these catches involving species threatened with extinction.  Most regulations were designed to prevent shark finning specifically not shark fi shing so they failed to reduce mortality overall  says Bradley.But there is some positive news: The study shows that in countries with shark sanctuaries like the Bahamas and the Maldives shark-fi shing mortality is relatively low likely allowing shark populations to recover and thrive.    thomaspeschak,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/08/nature_org_18040040402066267.jpeg,0.18191,2024-08-21 17:00:00,IMAGE,Posts_nature_org_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_7883_CLEANED_119.jpeg

High Stakes on the High PlainsSpanning 71 million acres across New Mexico Colorado Kansas Oklahoma and Texas an ecosystem known as the Southern High Plains is one of the world s most intact grasslands. Yet it is imperiled. Globally grasslands are the world s most threatened and least-protected ecosystems  says Galen Guerrero-Murphy director of the Southern High Plains Initiative for TNC. But a regional partnership known as the Southern High Plains Initiative aims to protect large connected landscapes to allow species to move and adapt to climate change while also preserving a way of life for local communities. Since 2020 the initiative has also helped conserve land by providing incentives to help ranchers and farmers invest in sustainable and regenerative practices. Those efforts are making an impact in the Southern High Plains and driving innovations that can be exported to grasslands everywhere.  These open spaces are integral to every facet of these communities  Guerrero-Murphy says.  We aren t going to limit our ambition to one polygon on the map.  slide 1:  Wolfe Repass/TNC Photo Contest 2019slide 2:  Brent Cavanaughslide 3:  Joel Jones,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/08/nature_org_17891443956077808.jpeg,0.17906,2024-08-27 00:00:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_nature_org_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_7883_CLEANED_122.jpeg

The age-old debate is about real vs. fake Christmas trees. Which one is better? The answer might surprise you!  Consider these facts about artificial trees: * 10 million are purchased every holiday season* Nearly 90% are shipped internationally* Most end up in landfills because they cant be recycled Working forests play an important role in conservation and when theyre sustainably managed they can produce renewable resources like Christmas trees and other wood-made products. So go ahead and purchase a real tree and support local tree farmers who help maintain healthy forests for generations.  : 1. James Brooks2. Scott Copeland3.

When a former copper mine in Strafford Vermont was leaching toxic metals and chemicals into the local river the town s residents partnered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to clean up the site stabilize the mine s dam and build a wetland that would protect the surrounding environment from mine waste. A decade later the town took another giant leap voting to develop a new solar project on the former mine site. The Elizabeth Mine Solar Project came online in 2016 and was soon generating 5 megawatts of energy - enough to power every home in Strafford. This project shows that when we site solar energy on lands that are already industrialized and degraded we can maximize benefits for people and minimize impacts on nature.

SNOW PROBLEM!Cornices form along the rim of Crater Lake in Oregon. These overhanging masses of soft or hardened snow form by wind deposits on the leeward side of ridges or summits. But the breathtaking beauty of these dollops of snow hides a deadly hazard: the snow can break off dragging hikers mountaineers and skiers with it--or even triggering an avalanche. If youre adventuring in the mountains this winter or spring treat these snow structures with respect by giving them a wide berth and avoiding slopes beneath them. Did you suspect this dreamy photo hid a seasonal hazard?

RECORD-SETTING REPTILE    A satellite tag attached to a nesting leatherback recently revealed that the turtle dove more than 4400 feet below the ocean s surface logging the deepest dive ever recorded by a marine reptile and surpassing the depth of a navy submarine!   Leatherback turtles are declining across the world s oceans. The population in the Western Pacific is critically endangered with only an estimated 1400 breeding adults remaining.    Scientists at The Nature Conservancy are working with rangers in the Solomon Islands to monitor the species  nesting beaches while satellite tags track their movements from the tropics to cold-water foraging grounds to determine where the turtles are at risk from long-line fisheries--and how they can protect them.

Grizzlies are magnificent and striking animals and let s be honest a little intimidating. Though it is an amazing experience to see one of these beauties in real life it s important to learn safety tips.The Greater Yellowstone grizzly bear population has increased from less than 200 in the 1980s to more than 1000 today. As the species spreads out the odds of seeing one increases. So it s important we learn to share our planet! Here are some tips to keep both yourself and these creatures safe:    Store food and garbage in bear-resistant bins. Don t tempt them with food they shouldn t eat and save yourself a bear encounter!    Carry bear spray. Be loud to warn bears you re on the path. Have bear spray in hand in case of a face-to-face encounter.    Look for a certified seal on your cooler. Basically a captive grizzly tried to get through the cooler couldn t and now it s certified!  Respect their space. Seeing a bear in real life is super cool but keep a safe distance for both their safety and yours. Tuck these tips in your back pocket for the next time you re setting off into bear country.

Fantastic Beasts and How to Save ThemWith an estimated 26% of the world s mammal species globally threatened or extinct a study published in One Earth and co-authored by Nature Conservancy scientists highlights a better way to fight for their survival. Conservation tends to focus on areas of species richness. But safeguarding one biodiverse hot spot might not be enough to save a species across its range says study lead author Nicholas Wolff TNC s global director of climate science.Many locations with critical populations of just a small number of species are vitally important for avoiding extinctions. Rather than prioritize land protection based solely on biological diversity as has historically been the case researchers modeled what would happen if conservationists also incorporated population-level information such as the growth rates and habitat needs of every individual population of a species. Results showed that only 8% of the areas upon which at-risk mammals depend most for their survival fall within strict protection categories. The key takeaway is that we can t only go to the most species-rich places. We have to think about how best to protect each population  says Wolff noting that this approach could reduce species extinction risk twice as efficiently as current methods.  We ll need to move quickly to halt extinctions but we finally have the tools.  Kirsten Weir :1. Red Panda: Dr. Axel Gebauer/naturepl.com2. African Wild Dog: Laurent Geslin/naturepl.com3.

Have you ever wondered how small forest owners can play a big role in combating climate change?Jack Lampman feels most at home tromping through the forests and summiting mountains in New York s Adirondack Mountains. As a professional forester he sees the toll invasive pests diseases and unnaturally high deer numbers are taking on the forests  ability to act as a natural solution to climate change. But thanks to a grant from the Inflation Reduction Act the U.S. government s biggest-ever investment in climate action Lampman is now working with individuals and families who own small parcels of forestland to help them improve their forests health for the long term and get paid to do it through the Family Forest Carbon Program. Family forest owners in the U.S. are responsible for 39% of all forestland in the country more than all other ownership groups including the federal government. The Family Forest Carbon Program pays landowners to keep their forests intact and implement management practices that are scientifically proven to capture more carbon and improve forest health.Click the link in our bio to learn more.  : Jack Lampman/TNC,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/01/nature_org_18057623608779834.jpeg,0.13743,2025-01-13 23:01:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_nature_org_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_7883_CLEANED_156.jpeg

If you re anything like us you LOVE sea turtles. Loving sea turtles means committing to their conservation. However this is no easy feat. Hawksbill and leatherbacks embark on incredible journeys across the ocean but little is known about where they go. This lack of knowledge complicates efforts to save them.At TNC we re dedicated to unlocking the secrets of their migration through satellite tagging programs. By collaborating closely with local communities we re gaining insights into their movements and patterns. This allows us to better protect the habitats where they nest migrate and feed.

This legislation has paved the way for tremendous innovative conservation funding. In just 25 years the Tropical Forest Conservation Act has helped protect 68 million acres of forests and coral reefs with local and global significance. We congratulate the Government of Indonesia and the U.S. Treasury Department for closing yet another bilateral TFCCA deal today which is the first time that this specific instrument is being used to protect marine habitat and corals.  - Jennifer Morris CEO The Nature ConservancyOn the 25th anniversary of the Tropical Forest and Coral Reef Conservation Act we re thrilled to announce a new TFCCA debt-for-nature swap with Indonesia. Through this agreement $35 million will go towards supporting local projects that are protecting and restoring the country s coral reef habitats and helping to create sustainable livelihoods for communities that rely on these marine ecosystems.Indonesia is home to a whopping 16% of the world s coral reefs and many of these habitats are facing huge threats. Healthy coral reefs provide essential habitat for a quarter of all marine animals including many commercially important fish and shellfish species so this agreement will be critical to protecting marine biodiversity and achieving our ambitious conservation goals. :1-2.

Wild HarvestSummer is a season of abundance especially when it comes to wild berries from the big four strawberries blueberries blackberries and raspberries to lesser-known fruits like huckleberries thimbleberries and cloudberries. Here s how to get the most from your forages:  Monitor what s in season for your area and go early to scout locations. Checkpublic land along coastal areas in and at the edges of forests in urban greenpatches and along sunsoaked field borders.  Some national parks and TNC preserves like Kennebunk Plains Preserve in Maine allow berry picking but you may need a permit. Be aware of and abide by local laws.  Keep in mind forager tips and etiquette: Wear long sleeves only eat what you know harvest healthy looking plants and respectthe local wildlife.  Never pick a patch bare bears and birds are hungry too so sprinkle seeds as you go to spread bounty for the future.

Is somebody going to match their freak?? Hard to say. There are many strange species that lurk in the waters. Here are just a few of our favorites: Weighing up to 8800 lbs elephant seals are fighters who will defend their territories at all costs. The results can be loud bloody battles.  The cookie-cutter shark equipped with razor-sharp teeth chisels off chunks of flesh leaving craters on their prey. From other seals to whales these sharks don t let their small size stop them from snacking.   Sea cucumbers are vital ecosystem engineers who crawl across the seafloor vacuuming up sand and pooping it back out again. Their feeding activity helps distribute nutrients and remove excess organic matter from the water.   With their sinister grins and two sets of jaws moray eels can use their pharyngeal jaw to help ensnare prey and pull it into the eel s throat.

Spot CheckFor years Nature Conservancy partner Panthera has been placing tracking collars on cheetahs and other big cats in Zambias Kafue National Park and the game management areas that surround it. The data is used to monitor population dynamics and prevent human wildlife conflict in community areas.In 2022 TNC teamed up with Panthera to expand their collaring efforts. Across the Kafue ecosystem TNC is working to halt poaching prevent habitat loss as well as empower communities to protect wildlife and effectively manage their lands. By keeping tabs on the health of carnivore populations conservationists can learn how the animals respond to different protection efforts across the landscape. And data suggest that they are proving successful: Recently one collared cheetah safely traveled about 700 miles over eight months.

Where there is food there are robins! These food-motivated creatures can be spotted even on the coldest winter days. True to their name Turdus migratorius ( the wandering thrush ) they spend their winters coming and going as they please.When the ground freezes in the fall and winter robins lose access to their favorite meals: worms insects and snails. Thats when they switch to a diet of mostly fruit and berries.

Agrivoltaics and ecovoltaics (respectively the process of crops or wildlife-supporting plants around solar arrays) have been around for a few decades but they are rather new practices in the United States. That s why TNC is partnering with the non-profit Colorado Agrivoltaic Learning Center to learn how solar farming and traditional farming can coexist. The learning center is based at JacksSolarGarden near Longmont Colorado where farmers grow crops and researchers study the details of how growing conditions vary around solar arrays. Last year TNC partnered with another local solar farm in Boulder and members of the learning center to study how existing solar arrays can be retrofitted to support crops.

Birds of a FeatherThe wedge-tailed shearwater and the blue-gray noddy [  swipe to see] two seabirds last seen on Palmyra Atoll during World War II were discovered last fall on the remote Pacific Ocean island chain when Nature Conservancy scientists used an artificial intelligence program to review TNC drone footage. The discovery showcases the role AI can play in conservation says TNC s Island Resilience Lead Scientist Alex Wegmann.  We would never have found either of those birds looking at the image data on our own.  Earlier in the year TNC scientists also documented the presence of a grey-backed tern chick another encouraging sign for TNC s goal of restoring habitat for eight seabird species that once called Palmyra home by removing invasive species like rats.
