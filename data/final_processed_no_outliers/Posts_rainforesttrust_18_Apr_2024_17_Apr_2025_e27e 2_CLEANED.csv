Hunters and poachers are driving the Helmeted Hornbill toward extinction across Southeast Asia. The Critically Endangered Helmeted Hornbill is the target of massive-scale poaching for the  ivory  in the brightly colored bony casque adorning its head. The bird is being hunted to extinction across its range in Southeast Asia and without protection its very existence is in jeopardy. An expanse of rainforest in the Indonesian territory of Borneo stands as a crucial stronghold for the Helmeted Hornbill and seven other hornbill species. The area is renowned for its largely pristine landscape of lowland rainforest heath forests and peat swamps. With less than 20% of the forest in Indonesia designated as Conservation Forests it is urgent that we safeguard this important hornbill habitat.

Good news from Chinko the extremely remote wilderness in eastern Central African Republic where deforestation and poaching threaten Critically Endangered African Forest Elephants Endangered Eastern Chimpanzees and African Wild Dogs and Vulnerable Lions.  Tracking data revealed a dramatic recovery of the lion population and a healthy population of chimpanzees in the area protected by Rainforest Trust s conservation work. In Chinko where the forest meets the savanna pastoralist herders convert wilderness habitat to cattle pasture and poaching driven by poverty and civil unrest is rampant.  Rainforest Trust is supporting land management that guides herders to areas outside the conservation area where they can graze their cattle. By the end of 2024 we had expanded the zone that limits human-wildlife interaction to over 7850 square miles. The track count from 2024 indicates the lion population has exceeded 2012 levels the highest on record before human encroachment into the area.

Exciting news from a Rainforest Trust project in Indonesia! A total of 252678 acres   of rare and fragile rainforest habitat on Peling Island is now formally designated to protect the astounding biodiversity that can only be found in this unique ecoregion.  This habitat is the last refuge on Earth for the Critically Endangered Benggai Crow whose total surviving population is estimated to be between 50 to 249 individuals and the Endangered Peleng Tarsier a tiny primate only found on this island. Many other threatened species will also now be safe from spreading deforestation for agriculture and development. This project ended up being more than five times as large as originally proposed thanks to the diligent work of our conservation staff and our partner burung_indonesia  Established in two sites the Kokolomboi and the Bajomoute Pondi-Pondi threatened wildlife will now benefit from a community-led system that accommodates biodiversity conservation and sustainable livelihoods for local communities. . . . .

The Zanzibar archipelago dates back to the end of the Pleistocene when melting glaciers and rising seas separated the islands from the rest of Tanzania and the African continent.  Endemic species those found here and nowhere else are plentiful. Among those is the Zanzibar Red Colobus an endangered primate with a global population of fewer than 6000. Every single one of those individuals lives on Ungula the largest of Zanzibar s islands. But rampant deforestation is quickly destroying their habitat leaving them with a smaller range and greater vulnerability every year.

Surprisingly little is known about the world s largest fish the Endangered Whale Shark which reaches an impressive 39 feet in length on average.  We do not know where they breed or birth their young. We do not know how long they live. And we are only just beginning to understand their migratory patterns across the world s oceans. But we do know that they congregate in large groups in a handful of places around the world. One of those places is Tandavandriva Nosy Be a marine area off the northwest coast of Madagascar.  Here Rainforest Trust and our partner Wildlife Conservation Society Madagascar are working to help the Madagascar government create the 695400-acre Tandavandriva Nosy Be Marine Protected Area.  This will link two existing MPAs creating a total protected area of more than 1.37 million acres that will safeguard hundreds of species of corals and fishes including the Whale Shark.

The Coral Triangle in the western Pacific Ocean holds over 600 species of coral more than anywhere else in the world.  These reefs and the adjacent mangrove and seagrass beds create a global hotspot of tropical marine diversity that is threatened by destructive fishing practices and exploitation of its fisheries.  Sea turtles sharks rays whales dolphins porpoises dugongs (a relative of manatees) and over 2000 species of fish rely on the Coral Triangle but their survival is uncertain in the face of blast and cyanide fishing.

With the rainy season still weeks or months away fires   continue to rage across much of South America. The crisis is international even global in scale but the response is often local and volunteer-based.  On September 23 a team of volunteers from Rainforest Trust partner Natura Bolivia and the communities of El Torno and Samaipata joined the fight against the flames in Bolivia s Bajo Paragu . Working together with other teams of volunteers they beat back the flames carve out firebreaks and respond as new fires start. The gear and training that keeps the Natura Bolivia team safe and the equipment that helps them combat the flames were purchased with funding from Rainforest Trust.  As the risk of wildfire increases globally more and more of our projects include funding for fire-fighting equipment protective gear and training.

In the Amazon region of eastern Bolivia over 92% of the land about 14.3 million acres is still forested.  Alarmingly Bolivia had the second-highest rate of primary forest loss in 2023 (after Brazil) of all the Amazon countries and deforestation here is increasing.  The Pando department (state) is a prime target for industrial agriculture that aims to transform biodiverse Amazon rainforest into lucrative cattle pastures and soy farms to feed the cattle releasing large amounts of carbon and mirroring the tragedy taking place in Brazil. You can help protect 2000000 acres here safeguarding habitat for species like the Vulnerable White-lipped Peccary.

Located on the northern slope of Mount Kenya the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy protects the only wildlife corridor that connects Mount Kenya s upper slopes to Kenya s Northern Rangelands. This land is a safe haven for threatened wildlife in northern Kenya including 14% of the country s Black Rhino   population and the world s single largest population of Grevy s Zebra. In 2023 the Lewa-Borana landscape reached its capacity for rhinos. As one of the Conservancy s special projects Lewa in collaboration with the Kenya Wildlife Service began plans to translocate rhinos in 2024 to various sanctuaries in other parts of the country a significant step forward in saving this endangered species.  So far Lewa has carried out two successful rhino translocations to nearby conservancies to promote further species recovery. These strategic translocations have relieved pressure on Lewa s carrying capacity and are facilitating the revitalization of these crucial species within their new homes.

In South America the Tropical Andes stretch along the junction of the Andes Mountains and Amazon Biome where varying elevations create pockets of unique habitat that support astounding biodiversity. Many species in the Tropical Andes are restricted to a distinct elevation and range making them very vulnerable to habitat destruction. Mining poses the most immediate threat of habitat loss but oil and gas exploration lies on the horizon. Without protection this exceptionally intact area could very soon be degraded by extractive industries. You can help protect 340500 acres of this landscape for rare amphibians and other threatened species.

Indigenous Peoples steward three-quarters of the world s remaining biodiversity.  They have been the unsung guardians of our planet for millenia due to their sustainable traditional ways of life that have endured in harmony with nature.  Rainforest Trust has always been committed to supporting Indigenous and traditional communities in their struggle to secure legal land tenure and management rights of their territories. The majority of projects we have supported to protect and conserve 52 million acres around the world were only made possible by collaborating with Indigenous Peoples and local communities.  Today on International Day of the Worlds Indigenous Peoples we hope you will join us in celebrating the rich history knowledge and culture of Indigenous Peoples and support their efforts to protect and conserve our Earth s natural abundance.

In Brazil the world s largest wetland rich in biodiversity and a critical stopover for migrating birds is in danger of drying up as temperatures rise water is overused land is converted for agriculture and wildfires burn. The Pantanal covers over 43.5 million acres across west-central Brazil eastern Bolivia and Paraguay. It is the world s largest wetland 20 times larger than the Florida Everglades and harbors extraordinary biodiversity.  Although significant portions of the Pantanal remain relatively pristine only 4.6% is currently protected and competing interests for land impede opportunities to conserve large-scale wilderness areas.
