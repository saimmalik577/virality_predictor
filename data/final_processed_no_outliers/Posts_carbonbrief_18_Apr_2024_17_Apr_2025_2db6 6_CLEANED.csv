In 2024 coal-power output in the US fell to its lowest level in 50 years according to new analysis by the Rhodium Group.  As the first chart shows for the first time ever the combined output from solar and wind surpassed coal in the US electricity mix.  Transport remained the highest-emitting sector in the US with a 0.8% increase in emissions driven by post-pandemic rebounds in jet fuel and petrol consumption (see the second chart) However despite coal-power hitting a 60-year low greenhouse gas emissions barely budged in 2024   falling just 0.2%.Currently the US  is not on track to meet either its 2030 Paris Agreement target of a 50-52% reduction in emissions relative to 2005 levels or its newly set 2035 goal of a 61-66% reduction.As the third chart shows to bridge the gap between the current US trajectory and its stated goals would require an average emissions reduction of 7.6% every year from 2025 through to 2030. This would be more than two-thirds of the drop seen as a result of Covid lockdowns in 2020.Click the link in our bio for more on the Rhodium analysis.#USEmissions #ParisAgrement #Emissions #Decarbonisation,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/01/carbonbrief_17998547144572942.jpeg,7.34035,2025-01-10 17:36:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_0.jpeg
The UK s greenhouse gas emissions fell by 3.6% in 2024 according to new Carbon Brief analysis.As the chart in slide 2 shows this is the UK s lowest annual emissions since 1872 and on par with 1926 when there was a general strike. In 1872 Queen Victoria was on the throne and Wanderers beat Royal Engineers in the first-ever FA Cup final held at Kennington Oval in south London.  Coal use also dropped to the lowest level since 1666 the year of the Great Fire of London.Key drivers of declining emissions include...  Closing of the UK s last coal-fired power station  A nearly 40% rise in electric vehicles  Above-average temperatures  Record renewables in electricity mix  But the UK would still need to cut its emissions by a larger amount each year than it did in 2024 to reach its international climate goal for 2035 as well as its national target to reach net-zero by 2050.Click the link in our bio to read the full analysis.#UKpolicy #EnergyTransition #CoalPower #Renewables,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/03/carbonbrief_18040146317165340.jpeg,6.59921,2025-03-13 17:26:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_1.jpeg
The Climate Change Committee (CCC) says reducing UK emissions by 87% by 2040 would put the country on track for net-zero   and cut household bills by  1400.  Specifically the CCC recommends massive reduction of emissions from sectors such as surface transport building heat industry and the power sector historically the UK s largest polluters. As the lower chart in slide two shows by 2040 aviation and agriculture would be the UK s largest emitters. Even in 2050 these sectors would continue to have significant emissions.While reaching net-zero requires upfront investment the CCC says it would...  Boost energy security  Reduce reliance on fossil fuels  Lower long-term costs  By 2050 households could see energy bills drop by  700 and motoring costs fall by another  700.  As shown in the third slide the net-cost of the UK reaching net-zero is now also 73% lower than the CCC thought five years ago. The chart also shows the capital investments and operational savings that make up the net cost overall.Click the link in our bio for the full analysis of the latest CCC report.#ClimateChange #UKpolicy #NetZero #EnergyTransition,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/02/carbonbrief_17842814595433185.jpeg,4.86311,2025-02-27 18:12:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_2.jpeg
A record surge of clean energy kept China s CO2 emissions below the previous year s levels in the last 10 months of 2024.  While China s CO2 output in 2024 grew by an estimated 0.8% year-on-year emissions were lower than in the 12 months to February 2024 as chart 1 shows.  Meanwhile clean-energy capacity growth is expected to accelerate in 2025 as large-scale wind solar and nuclear projects near completion. Chart 2 captures this expected growth which could generate more than 600TWh per year of electricity.  However another period of industrial demand growth driven by government stimulus efforts could slow down China s coal-power phaseout.Click the link in our bio for the full analysis.#Renewable #China #EnergyTransition #Emissions,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/01/carbonbrief_18095693413508794.jpeg,4.10505,2025-01-28 16:54:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_3.jpeg
This year is now virtually certain to beat 2023 as the hottest year on record Carbon Brief analysis shows.  It will also be the first full year to surpass 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.  The chart shows Carbon Brief s estimate of where 2024 temperatures will end up according to different research groups based on the year to date and expected El Ni o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions in the tropical Pacific for the remainder of the year.  This analysis is based on records from five different research groups that report global surface temperature records: NASA s GISTEMP NOAA s GlobalTemp Hadley/UEA s HadCRUT5 Berkeley Earth and Copernicus/ECMWF.The dots reflect the best estimate while the whiskers show the two sigma (95%) confidence interval of the projections. The prior record year (2023 in all groups) is shown by the coloured square.In all cases the projected global average temperature for 2024 is virtually certain to exceed the prior record set in 2023.

Heatwaves around the world are becoming more frequent and intense because of human-caused warming. They are made even more severe in cities by the urban heat island (UHI) effect which traps heat in urban areas due to urban infrastructure such as:  closely packed buildings  heat-absorbing surfaces such as concrete  human activity such as driving carsCooler air from surrounding rural areas can reduce a city s temperature by more than 0.5C if land cover is optimised a new study has found giving recommendations such as:  joining up patches of rural land  planting more woodland  having fewer bigger lakesHigher urban temperatures lead to a  heat dome  forming over a city illustrated in the diagram above. The diagram shows how colder air (blue) from the neighbouring rural areas circulates into the urban centre exchanging with the hotter air (red).To learn more about how the rural  buffer ring  can help keep our cities cool click the link in our bio  #UrbanHeat #Cooling #Heatwave #Adaptation #ClimateChange,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/08/carbonbrief_18027987482191091.jpeg,2.54128,2024-08-07 15:36:00,IMAGE,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_5.jpeg
In a scenario where emissions are not rapidly cut the world will likely exceed the Paris 1.5C limit in the late 2020s or early 2030s   rather than in the next few years according to Carbon Brief analysis.  The analysis uses both the latest global surface temperature data and climate model simulations.  Click the link in our bio to read the full analysis.  Global temperatures in 2023 blew past expectations to set the warmest year on record even topping 1.5C in one of the main datasets.This warmth has continued into 2024 meaning that this year is also on track to potentially pass 1.5C in one or more datasets.  However crossing 1.5C in one or even two years is not the same as exceeding the 1.5C limit under the Paris Agreement.  The goal is generally considered to refer to long-term warming rather than annual temperatures that include the short-term influence of natural fluctuations in the climate such as El Ni o.  Nonetheless recent warming has led to renewed debate around whether the world might imminently pass the 1.5C Paris Agreement limit   sooner than climate scientists and the IPCC have previously estimated.  #GlobalWarming #ClimateChange #ParisAgreement #ClimateScience,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/06/carbonbrief_17864717529152638.jpeg,2.4533,2024-06-18 17:18:00,IMAGE,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_6.jpeg
China generated more electricity from solar power in May 2024 alone than most countries did in the whole of 2023 according to data analysed by Carbon Brief.  As shown in the chart China generated 94 terawatt hours (TWh) from solar in May 2024 while in all of 2023 India only generated 113 TWh and Japan 97 TWh.  If China s current rapid wind and solar deployment continues then its CO2 output from coal is likely to continue falling making 2023 the peak year for the country s emissions.

A global treaty on plastics being negotiated in  South Korea next week could have important implications for climate change.  The production use and disposal of plastics is responsible for around 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions and they are typically made from fossil fuels.  Carbon Brief analysis shows that without any agreement to cut plastic production emissions from plastics could consume half of the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. One expert tells Carbon Brief that the best outcome possible for the negotiations is to ratify a global target to limit plastics production coupled with legally binding national targets. However she warns that oil-producing countries are likely to veto any such proposal.

There is a 95% probability that this year will surpass 2023 as the warmest year on record Carbon Brief analysis indicates.  This projection emerges amid a series of climate extremes that have marked the first half of 2024.  For example the first six months of 2024 have each set new temperature records extending an already remarkable streak of 13 consecutive record-breaking months dating back to 2023.  The chart shows a heat map of daily global average temperatures since 1940 in the Copernicus/ECMWF ERA5 dataset. The temperatures are represented by colours ranging from blue (-2C) to red (+2C) with the pre-industrial average (1850-1900) set to 0C.Click the link in our bio for the full analysis.#ExtremeWeather #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming #TemperatureRecord #GlobalTemperature,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/08/carbonbrief_18032479127278191.jpeg,2.08108,2024-08-13 15:56:00,IMAGE,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_9.jpeg
2024 was the hottest year on record since global temperature tracking began in the mid-1800s and likely for thousands of years before.  For the first time average global surface temperatures exceeded 1.5C above pre-industrial levels in most leading datasets.  This does not mean the Paris Agreement s 1.5C limit has been breached as that refers to long-term warming. However it s a clear signal that the world is nearing this critical threshold.  If global emissions remain on the current trajectory the world will likely firmly pass 1.5C in the late 2020s or early 2030s as shown in the first chart above.  In the latest State of the Climate report Carbon Brief unpacks the latest data from the oceans atmosphere cryosphere and surface temperatures. The charts above illustrate some of the report s findings.2  The second chart shows global surface temperature records from five different datasets: NASA NOAA the Met Office Hadley Centre/University of East Anglia s (UEA) HadCRUT5 Berkeley Earth and Copernicus ERA5.3  The third chart shows each month of 2024 in black compared to all prior years since 1940. Each year is coloured based on the decade in which it occurred with the clear warming over time visible as well as the margin by which both 2023 and 2024 exceeded past years.4  The fourth chart shows five different modern sea level rise datasets (blue lines) along with satellite altimeter measurements as assessed by NASA (in black) after 1993. (As sea level rise data has not yet been released for the whole year the 2024 value is estimated based on data through to October.)5  The final figure shows both Arctic (red line) and Antarctic (blue line) sea ice extent for each day of the year along with how it compares to the historical range (corresponding shading).

A forest twice the size of Greater London would need to be planted in the UK to cancel out the extra emissions from the expansion of Heathrow Gatwick and Luton airports Carbon Brief analysis reveals.  As the chart shows more runways at these airports would significantly increase emissions by 2050 if the number of flights increases in line with their operating company targets.  Offsetting these emissions would require more than 300000 hectares of trees to be planted within just a few years. This equates to all the trees planted in the UK since 2000.Despite opposition from the governments climate advisors and its own members the Labour party is set to back all three airport expansions.Click the link in our bio for the full analysis.#UKpolicy #Emissions #Labour #Decarbonisation #Heathrow,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/01/carbonbrief_18035275022184891.jpeg,1.85116,2025-01-29 13:20:00,IMAGE,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_11.jpeg
Fossil-fuel electricity generation in the EU has dropped to its lowest level in 40 years driven by a surge in solar and wind power according to new data from emberenergyresearch.  Coal use in the EU has fallen by 61% over the past decade while solar output has tripled and wind generation has more than doubled.  As shown in the chart above 2024 was a milestone year   solar overtook coal for the first time.Meanwhile this clean energy growth has saved the EU  59bn in fossil-fuel imports and avoided 460MtCO2 emissions over five years.

Atmospheric CO2 is rising faster than ever according to data from the Mauna Loa observatory which has tracked CO2 levels for over 60 years. The increase now exceeds pathways set by the IPCC to limit global warming to 1.5C.  As illustrated by the iconic Keeling Curve above the increase has been accelerating over the decades (blue line) due to ongoing emissions of CO2 from burning fossil fuels and changing land use. So while the curve needs to rapidly bend in the other direction to hold warming to 1.5C (light red line) the rate of rising CO2 marches onwards and upwards.  In 2024 the rise in CO2 levels was among the fastest on record.Click the link in our bio to read the full analysis.#C02 #GlobalWarming #Emissions #ClimateChange,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/01/carbonbrief_18046562855230439.jpeg,1.76994,2025-01-20 17:26:00,IMAGE,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_13.jpeg
More than 85% of countries are set to miss the UN s deadline to submit new nature pledges ahead of the COP16 biodiversity summit in  Colombia according to a joint investigation by Carbon Brief and the Guardian.  Three of the G7 nations are among those not to publish new national pledges known as national biodiversity strategies and action plans (NBSAPs).  Meanwhile only five of the 17  megadiverse countries    which together provide a home to 70% of the world s biodiversity   have produced new pledges for tackling nature loss. The three nations that hold the vast majority of the Amazon rainforest    Brazil  Peru and COP16 host nation  Colombia   have all failed to produce new nature plans before the talks.  Yet biodiversity on Earth is declining at a faster rate than at any time in human history.

Greenhouse gas emissions from the   Paris 2024 Olympics are expected to be less than half of those from London 2012 according to Carbon Brief analysis.  As the chart shows the Paris total is set to be even lower than the emissions from the   Tokyo 2020 games held in 2021 when emissions were significantly reduced due to a ban on spectators amid the Covid-19 pandemic.  Organisers said they had aimed to reduce emissions through use of temporary and low-carbon construction materials as well as by encouraging sustainable travel.The emissions figures exclude any carbon offsets and for  Rio 2016 do not include emissions from legacy construction.

The UK has become the first major economy   and first G7 member   to shut down all its coal-fired power plants.The last plant Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire closed on September 30 ending a 142-year era of burning coal to generate electricity.From 1882 until Ratcliffe s closure the UK s coal plants will have burned through 4.6bn tonnes of coal and emitted 10.4bn tonnes of CO2   more than most countries have ever produced from all sources Carbon Brief analysis shows.Meanwhile the phaseout was built on four key elements: 1  First the availability of alternative electricity sources sufficient to meet and exceed rising demand. 2  Second bringing the construction of new coal capacity to an end. 3  Third pricing externalities such as air pollution and CO2 thus tipping the economic scales in favour of alternatives. 4  Fourth the government setting a clear phaseout timeline a decade in advance giving the power sector time to react and plan ahead.In a detailed and interactive explainer Carbon Brief explains:  How the UK stopped using coal power  Where the UK gets its electricity from today  What comes next for the UK s electricity mix  What other countries can learn from the UK phaseoutClick the link in our bio to read the full explainer.#UKpolicy #CoalPower #FossilFuels #Emissions,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/10/carbonbrief_18061317607733059.jpeg,1.44829,2024-10-01 17:56:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_17.jpeg
In 2024 renewables   solar in particular   continued to grow at record speed according to data compiled by thinktank emberenergyresearch   As shown in the first chart above solar added more than twice as much generation in 2024 as any other source.  In total low-carbon energy sources   renewables and nuclear   provided 40.9% of the world s electricity.  The growth in clean energy is particularly stark in China where clean electricity additions met 81% of demand growth in 2024 as shown in chart two.  Clean electricity growth   which includes modest hydro and nuclear power growth   is expected to outpace electricity demand growth by 2030. This is illustrated in chart three.  Despite record renewable growth global power-sector emissions hit an  all-time high  in 2024 according to Ember s analysis.  Embers  analysis finds that the increase in fossil-fuel generation was in particular due to hotter temperatures in 2024 which drove up electricity demand in key regions such as India.Click the link in our bio to learn more about how Ember is interpreting the power sector data.#PowerSector #Emissions #Renewables #EnergyTransition,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/04/carbonbrief_17930964999013520.jpeg,1.44844,2025-04-08 18:01:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_18.jpeg

Global electricity generation from solar   will quadruple by 2030 and help to push coal power into reverse according to Carbon Brief analysis of data from the International Energy Agency (IEA).As shown in the chart solar is expected to become the world s largest source of electricity by 2033 overtaking nuclear wind hydro gas and finally coal.  This solar surge will help kickstart the  age of electricity  the IEA says where rapidly expanding clean electricity and  inherently  greater efficiency will push fossil fuels into decline.  As a result the world s energy-related C02 emissions   will reach a peak  imminently  the IEA says with its data indicating a turning point in 2025.

In 2023 wind and solar combined added more new energy to the global mix than any other source according to Carbon Brief s analysis of newly released data from the Energy Institute Statistical Review of World Energy 2024.As shown in chart 1  new energy from wind and solar in 2023 accounted for 40% of the overall increase in global energy demand ahead of oil (39%) and coal (20%).  This is the first time in history that these newer forms of renewable energy have outpaced each of the fossil fuelsHowever the global energy system still remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels.As shown in chart 2  record global demand for energy saw coal and oil use also reaching new highs last year.  Oil was the world s largest source of energy in 2023 accounting for nearly a third of the total energy mix (32%) having grown nearly every year for the past half-century. Coal was in second place representing 26% of the energy mix.

Extreme weather can harm food production in many different ways.  Analysing global media coverage over the past two years Carbon Brief has identified reports on extreme weather events that have damaged crops.Various impacts were recorded from floods ruining fields of corn in Tanzania  drought destroying coffee in Vietnam  to heat impacting the  famed  Cambodian Kampot pepper  .And in Jamaica  a hurricane destroyed millions of dollars  worth of crops in July 2024.  Many countries also faced a combination of weather extremes such as drought and heat battering crops at the same time.

The ability of governments to implement climate policies effectively is the  most important  factor in the feasibility of limiting global warming to 1.5C a new study says.  The study finds that the most ambitious climate mitigation trajectories give the world a 50% chance of limiting peak global warming to below 1.6C above pre-industrial temperatures. However adding  feasibility constraints    particularly those involving the effectiveness of governments   reduces this likelihood to 5-45%.  The study shows that thanks to advances such as solar wind or electric vehicles  the technological feasibility of climate-neutrality is no longer the most crucial issue  according to an author on the study.Instead he says  it is much more about how fast climate policy ambition can be ramped up by governments .Click the link in our bio for details about the study.#ClimatePolicy #GlobalWarming #ClimateChange #ClimateScience,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/08/carbonbrief_18005228195416614.jpeg,1.18097,2024-08-19 18:00:00,IMAGE,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_26.jpeg
The past 10 months have all set new all-time monthly global temperature records with April 2024 on track to extend this streak to 11.  This means that 2024 is shaping up to either match or surpass 2023 as the hottest year on record.  However the margin by which these new monthly records have been set has fallen from around 0.3C last year to 0.1C over the first three months of 2024.  The chart shows that global temperatures have been exceptionally high over the past three months   at around 1.6C above pre-industrial levels   following the peak of current El Ni o event at the start of 2024.  Based on the year so far and the current El Ni o forecast Carbon Brief estimates that global temperatures in 2024 are likely to average out at around 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.Click the link in our bio to read the latest  state of the climate  report.#GlobalWarming #ClimateChange #ElNi o #RecordTemperatures,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/04/carbonbrief_18131954308334972.jpeg,1.16743,2024-04-30 17:28:00,IMAGE,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_27.jpeg
Is the electricity grid in Great Britain becoming less dependent on fossil fuels?Fossils fuels supplied a record-low 2.4% of electricity on the island of Great Britain last month Carbon Brief analysis showed.The record low was reached at lunchtime on Monday 15 April and lasted for one hour.1  The first chart paints a picture of how British electricity supplies are shifting decisively away from fossil fuels. It s also reminiscent of Joy Division s iconic  Unknown Pleasures  album cover  It shows the distribution of half-hours in each year since 2009 arranged according to the share of fossil fuels during each time period. (Half-hours are the time period currently used for electricity market  settlement  when contracts for supply and demand are settled up.)2  The second chart communicates how unprecedented it is for fossil fuels to be meeting such low shares of demand on the GB grid also showing the share of electricity generated by fossil fuels in each half-hour period.During 2023 there were just 16 half-hour periods with less than 5% fossil fuels. In 2022 there were only five. In contrast there have already been 75 half-hours with less than 5% fossil fuels in 2024 to date.3  The shift to ever lower fossil fuel use is also illustrated in chart 3 which shows daily average shares starting to regularly drop below 10% in Dec 2023 and Apr 2024.  These findings show that National Grid Electricity System Operator is closing in on its target of running the country s electricity network without fossil fuels for short periods by 2025.Click the link in our bio for more information on the charts.#ClimateChange #BritishEnergy #FossilFuels #RenewableEnergy #NationalGrid #JoyDivision,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/05/carbonbrief_18024929344919727.jpeg,1.14375,2024-05-07 18:33:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_28.jpeg
In a warming world is climate change making extreme cold more common? There is significant debate in the scientific community about whether rapid Arctic warming and sea ice loss could disrupt atmospheric circulation patterns and lead to cold-air outbreaks in the northern hemisphere mid-latitude regions.  In a new analysis Carbon Brief shows that few places in the world have seen an increase in extreme cold days over the past 55 years.  If climate change is influencing atmospheric circulation any effects on extreme cold appear to be more than compensated by the rapid winter warming the world has experienced.To help assess the effects of climate change on extreme cold events Carbon Brief calculated how the temperatures of the coldest 5% of the days of the year have changed since the 1970s. Map 1 above shows the results for every grid cell on the Earth s land (a size approximately equivalent to 100km by 100km). Grid cells coloured red experienced a decrease in extreme cold days blue had more extreme cold days.Another way to assess changes in cold events is to look at the change in the number of days where any hour of the day   that is the daily minimum temperature   is below freezing. Map 2  shows the change in average annual freezing days between 1970 and 2024.

Attribution studies calculate whether climate change affected the intensity frequency or impact of extreme weather events.  In 2004 a trio of researchers published the first ever study to calculate the specific contribution that human-caused climate change made to an individual weather event.  To keep track of this rapidly growing field of research Carbon Brief has mapped every published study on how climate change has influenced extreme weather.  The latest iteration of the interactive map just published includes over 600 studies and covers around 750 extreme weather events and trends.  Across all these cases 83% of the events and trends included in the map were found to have been influenced by human-caused climate change.  First published in July 2017 this is the sixth   and most comprehensive   update to Carbon Brief s map.

More than half of all cars sold in China last month were electric.  For the first time ever electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrids  reached a record-high of 51.1% of retail sales in July according to data from the China Passenger Car Association. Meanwhile EVs are already noticeably reducing China s oil demand. Compared with a year earlier the increase in the number of EVs on China s roads cut demand for transport fuels by approximately 4%.

Countries  must deliver a quantum leap in ambition  if the world is to meet the Paris goal of limiting global warming to  well below  2C and pursuing efforts to stay under 1.5C a new UN report says.  The report comes as countries approach the February 2025 deadline to submit their next nationally determined contributions (NDCs) setting mitigation targets for 2035.  Published by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) the report charts the  gap  between where emissions are headed under current policies and commitments over the coming decade.  As the chart shows current policies put the world on track for 2.9C of warming by 2100 though this could be reduced to 2.4-2.6C if all existing NDCs are met (with a 50% chance). The dotted grey line in the chart shows a scenario with no new climate policies after 2010 dark blue shows existing policies already implemented and mid and light blue lines show additional conditional and unconditional NDCs. The pale red line shows emissions consistent with a below 2C trajectory the red line shows emissions consistent with a 1.5C trajectory.  However unless global emissions in 2030 are brought below the levels implied by current NDCs a pathway to 1.5C with no or limited overshoot becomes  impossible  the report says and  strongly  increases the challenge of limiting warming to 2C.Click the link in our bio for more details about the report.#ParisAgreement #GlobalEmissions #GlobalWarming #ClimateChange,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/10/carbonbrief_18045070852875427.jpeg,1.05238,2024-10-25 18:20:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_32.jpeg
Less than three years after signing a global biodiversity deal more than half of countries have yet to commit to its key target.  A Carbon Brief and guardian investigation reveals that 70 out of 137 nations submitting UN plans do not pledge to protect 30% of their land and sea by 2030 despite signing up to do so in a global deal just three years ago. Some countries set even lower targets while others avoid specific commitments altogether.As the chart shows this includes biodiversity-rich nations like  Indonesia  Peru and  South Africa as well as developed countries such as  Finland and  Switzerland. Together they represent over one-third of Earth s land surface.  The chart shows countries that have submitted NBSAPs. Each country is clustered by the percentage of land they have pledged to protect and the size of each bubble represents their land area.  Some nations argue that meeting  30 by 30  is too difficult particularly for developing countries. But experts warn that without stronger commitments the world is off track to meet its biodiversity goals.Click the link in our bio to read the full analysis.#Biodiversity #Nature #UNClimateTalks #ClimateChange,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/02/carbonbrief_17960714147890727.jpeg,1.03218,2025-02-26 18:00:00,IMAGE,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_33.jpeg
China s historical emissions within its borders have now caused more global warming than the 27 member states of the  EU combined according to new Carbon Brief analysis.However China is still far behind the  US in terms of historical emissions.  Based on current policies committed plans and technology trends in both countries China is unlikely to ever overtake the US contribution to global warming  In addition China s 1.4 billion people are each responsible for 227tCO2 a third of the 682tCO2 linked to the EU s 450 million citizens   and far below the 1570tCO2 per capita in the US.Click the link in our bio to read the full analysis.#Emissions #GlobalWarming #China #EuropeanUnion,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/11/carbonbrief_18113205583418235.jpeg,0.99147,2024-11-19 17:10:00,reel,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_34.jpeg
A global shift towards a diet that reduces  overconsumption  in meat and dairy products could cut 17% of global food emissions annually new research shows.  According to the study if consumers with higher dietary emissions reduced their red meat consumption in favour of more legumes and nuts global food-system emissions would fall by 32%.  At the same time improving the diets of  underconsuming  populations would result in a 15% increase in dietary emissions.  The authors suggest that changing the food choices of consumers could not only contribute to mitigating climate change but also to addressing inequality and food security.The lead author of the study also told Carbon Brief: I see food as a right so I work with the perspective that each of us should be allowed to choose the best practice to eat  It s important to ensure that [vulnerable groups] still have enough nutrition from animal-based products  There s still some room for the rich people to save some good resources for the poor ones .

Nearly a tenth of global climate finance could be under threat as Donald Trump s aid cuts risk wiping out huge swathes of spending overseas according to Carbon Brief analysis.  Last year the US announced that it had increased its climate aid for developing countries roughly seven-fold over the course of Joe Biden s presidency reaching $11bn per year (see the second slide).  This likely amounts to more than 8% of all international climate finance in 2024 as visualised in the third slide.  However any progress in US climate finance has been thrown into disarray by the new administration.  For example as shown in the fourth slide following Trump s cuts the US contribution to the Global Climate Fund is now lower than that of Sweden   a country with an economy 50 times smaller.Click the link in our bio to read the full analysis.#ClimateFinance #USpolicy #DonaldTrump #ClimateChange,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/03/carbonbrief_17870029347320870.jpeg,0.93743,2025-03-10 17:56:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_36.jpeg
Is the world warming faster than scientists expected?  Carbon Brief takes a detailed look at the question and finds that there is increasing evidence of an acceleration in the rate of warming over the past 15 years as the chart above shows.  Between 1970 and 2008 the world warmed at an approximately linear rate   by 0.18C per decade. However in recent years the rise in global surface temperatures has climbed above this long-term trend with eight of the past nine years showing warming levels above what would be expected given the historical warming rate.  However this acceleration is broadly in line with projections from the latest generation of climate models and the recent sixth assessment report (AR6) from the ipcc .

The last few years have seen a wide variety of record-shattering heat extremes around the world.  As the chart above shows record-shattering new national temperatures have been recorded during heatwaves across western Europeas well as in China and Canada.The Pacific north-west heatwave in 2021 when  Canada s temperature record was smashed in Lytton British Columbia is among the largest record-shattering heatwaves ever recorded.  Other record-shattering heat events from recent years include a year-long marine heatwave in the north Atlantic Ocean beginning in March 2023 when sea surface temperatures were up to 5C hotter than normal.

The UK s energy bills were  22bn higher over the past decade than they would have been if Conservative governments had not cut  green crap  climate policies.  In 2013 then-prime minister David Cameron was infamously reported to have asked colleagues to  get rid of the green crap  referring to climate policies supporting better home insulation.  Cameron s government later scrapped a  zero-carbon homes  standard for new-build homes ended support for solar power and blocked the expansion of onshore wind.  Carbon Brief s analysis shows that the  green crap  rollbacks left UK billpayers more exposed to record gas prices during the energy crisis. The impact of this exposure is reflected in this chart which shows how much higher energy bills are as a result of having installed less insulation and fewer wind or solar parks.Click the link in our bio for the full analysis.#UKpolicy #UKenergy #Heating #EnergyPrices #Renewables,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/07/carbonbrief_17976666209717387.jpeg,0.87981,2024-07-08 16:55:00,IMAGE,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_39.jpeg

Carbon Brief has factchecked Kemi Badenoch s claims about climate change and net-zero made during yesterday s speech launching a new Conservative  policy renewal programme .  Is the UK s net-zero target by 2050  impossible  to achieve without  bankrupting  the country? And is it true that  no one knows  why the target is 2050?  Opposition leader Kemi Badenoch has said this and more shattering the long-standing political consensus on climate change.  In reality in 2019 the UK s advisory Climate Change Committee considered the breadth of scientific evidence the economics of the transition as well as societal and technological trends when it offered detailed advice   covering 277 pages   on setting a net-zero by 2050 target. This target was passed into law by Badenoch s own Conservative party.  Carbon Brief examines this false claim along with several others in its latest factcheck.

China s CO2 emissions fell by 1% in the second quarter of 2024 according to new analysis for Carbon Brief.As chart 1  above shows it is the first quarterly fall since the country re-opened from its  zero-Covid  lockdowns in December 2022.  The reduction in CO2 emissions was driven by the surge in clean energy additions which is driving fossil fuel power into reverse. These shifts are shown in chart 2  which shows the year-on-year change in China s monthly electricity generation by source. lean power expansion (yellow and blue) started to exceed electricity demand growth in recent months pushing coal and gas power (grey) in the opposite direction.  However rapid energy demand growth driven by factors such as the industrial demand for power and gas diluted the impact of changes in the electricity sector. This indicates that the energy-intensive growth pattern that China followed during zero-Covid is continuing.

Natural  world heritage sites such as the Gal pagos Islands Serengeti national park and Great Barrier Reef could be exposed to multiple climate extremes by the end of the century a new study warns.  The study assesses the impacts of extreme heat rainfall and drought on 250 natural world heritage sites under different emissions scenarios.  As the maps above illustrate it finds that under a low-emissions scenario 33 of the 250 heritage sites will face at least one  climate pressure  by the end of the century. Under a moderate scenario this number rises to 188 sites.

China s reliance on coal for electricity has fallen to a record low.  This is largely due to the growth of clean energy sources such as solar and wind power.   As shown in the chart above clean energy generated a record-high 44% of China s electricity in May 2024 pushing coal s share down to a record low of 53% despite continued growth in coal demand according to a Carbon Brief analysis.  Coal lost seven percentage points when comparing May 2024 with May 2023 when it accounted for 60% of electricity generation in China.

The UK s electricity was the cleanest ever in 2024 new Carbon Brief analysis shows.  This is because the UK has phased out coal and is now getting less than half as much electricity from burning fossil fuels as a decade ago while renewable generation has more than doubled.Some 2024 numbers...  Gas: 28%  Wind: 26%  Nuclear: 13%  Biomass: 13%  Solar: 4%In total fossil fuels made up just 29% of the UK s electricity in 2024   the lowest level on record   while renewables reached a record-high 45% and nuclear was another 13%.Click the link in our bio to read the full analysis.#UKpolicy #UKenergy #Renewables #FossilFuel,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/01/carbonbrief_18482890960011120.jpeg,0.65654,2025-01-08 14:41:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_51.jpeg
The world is on track to install a record-breaking 593 gigawatts (GW) of new solar capacity in 2024 according to analysis by thinktank Ember.  This would be up 29% on 2023 levels and nearly six times the amount added just five years ago.In addition to established leaders such as  China  Europe and the  US Ember said there was strong growth in new markets such as  Pakistan and  Saudi Arabia in 2024.The thinktank added that solar growth continues to outpace many forecasts for the industry  put[ting] ambitious climate pledges within reach .#Renewables #Solar #Sustainability #EnergyTransition,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/10/carbonbrief_18068818858719650.jpeg,0.65309,2024-10-17 17:30:00,IMAGE,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_52.jpeg

Clean-energy technologies made up more than 10% of China s economy in 2024 for the first time ever with sales and investments worth 13.6tn yuan ($1.9tn).  Clean-energy sectors also drove a quarter of the country s GDP growth in 2024 and have overtaken real-estate sales in value.  As the chart shows investment in solar power capacity has grown 10-fold in just five years alongside spending on new wind hydro and nuclear capacity.  China s investment in clean energy was close to the global total put into fossil fuels in 2024 and was of a similar scale to the overall size of Saudi Arabia s economy.Click the link in our bio to read the full analysis#ChinaPolicy #EnergyTransition #Renewable #CleanEnergy,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/02/carbonbrief_18129844378392297.jpeg,0.63623,2025-02-20 18:15:00,IMAGE,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_54.jpeg
Many developing countries have criticised the  at least  $300bn-a-year-by-2035 pledge made by developed countries at COP29.  Although the goal was welcomed by global-north leaders closer analysis of the pledge and climate-finance data helps to explain the backlash:1  Much of the goal would have been raised anywayAnalysts have shown that the target is achievable with virtually  no additional budgetary effort  from developed countries beyond already-committed increases.2  Developing-country contributions could cover part of the goalUnlike the earlier $100bn target contributions from developing countries could count towards the new climate finance goal.3  Inflation wipes out much of the increase in climate financeThe $300bn target does not account for inflation.

Arctic sea ice has recorded its smallest winter peak extent since satellite records began 47 years ago new data reveals.   Provisional data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) shows that Arctic sea ice reached a winter maximum extent of 14.33m square kilometres last week.  Dr Julienne Stroeve a senior scientist at the NSIDC tells Carbon Brief that such a small winter peak  doesn t mean a record-low  summer minimum will necessarily follow in September.

China s CO2 emissions stayed at or just below last year s levels in the third quarter of 2024 after a fall in the second quarter.  This leaves open the possibility that China s emissions could fall this year.  However recent record-high temperatures caused emissions to go up in September and new government stimulus measures mean there is now greater uncertainty over the country s emissions trajectory.While wind and solar power growth continued to break records there was a 2% increase in coal-fired power generation and a 13% rise for gas-fired power.Click the link in our bio for the full analysis.#China #Emissions #Renewables #Coal #EnergyTransition,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/10/carbonbrief_18048389396073256.jpeg,0.50081,2024-10-29 18:08:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_66.jpeg
UK governments   in England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland   have fallen short of their tree-planting targets since 2020.  According to Carbon Brief calculations these missed targets amount to 22129 hectares of forest. As illustrated in the first chart this is an area nearly the size of Birmingham the nation s second most populous city.  Tree-planting can help the UK meet its climate targets by removing CO2 as well as improving biodiversity and providing protection from flooding. However UK tree planting rates have largely stalled since 2020 according to data from government body Forest Research.  The most recent dataset released on 20 June shows that only 20660 hectares of new woodlands were planted in 2023-24. While this is a significant jump from the previous three years it is still far short of the 30000 hectares target for 2025 as shown in the second chart.

Since the last European parliamentary election in 2019 the share of renewable generation across the EU increased by 10% according to Carbon Brief analysis.   The Netherlands increased its absolute share of renewable generation by close to 30% since 2019 as shown in the first chart. Nearly half the electricity produced in the Netherlands is now renewable according to the Dutch Central Bureau for Statistics. This was predominantly wind generation with the country adding more wind power than any other country in the EU between 2019 and 2023.   Latvia also saw significant growth with the share of renewables jumping from 49.5% in 2019 to 76.6% in 2023. This 27.1% increase is particularly key for the country as it continues to target reducing its dependence on energy imports from Russia.  Slovakia meanwhile was the only country to see a dip in its share of renewable energy when comparing 2019 and 2023. This was minor falling just 0.65% from 23.57% to 22.92%. The country has one of the smallest energy demands in Europe and saw a drop in hydro driven by droughts in 2022.

New research suggests more than half of global cropland areas could lose suitable crops under a warming scenario of 2C.  The study mapped how climate change could reshape areas suited for 30 major crops across four warming scenarios   from 1.5C to 4C. The chart above shows the percentage changes in global potential cropland area for all the crops under the four warming scenarios examined. Each colour represents a level of global warming.  Even at 1.5C over half of the crops studied could see a decline in suitable cropland with tropical regions hit hardest. In contrast areas far from the equator could gain crop diversity   opening doors for climate adaptation.

With the 2024 election looming forecasters predict a swing to the right in EU politics. A surge in far-right MEPs could result in a right-wing majority coalition within parliament.  This in turn could jeopardise the next phase of the EU s climate ambitions including negotiations over a European Commission proposal to reduce emissions by 90% by 2040.  In contrast as the chart above shows parties that are further to the left have backed more ambitious emissions targets.   The relatively centrist S&D and Renew Europe Now groupings support the proposed 90% goal for 2040.   Meanwhile other parties have gone even further. The European Green Party has proposed a  revised EU climate law  with a 2030 target that goes  beyond  the current 55% goal and achieves net-zero by 2040. The Left specifies a 65% reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2035.

What do India s elections mean for coal communities and climate change?   As shown in the first chart India s coal production has rapidly expanded under prime minister Narendra Modi.That expansion since 2014 has come with impacts on India s coal communities and the environment including:  forced evictions  deforestation  rising emissions  India s coal reserves are concentrated in states with significant Indigenous populations such as Chhattisgarh. Local communities who traditionally have strong links to land and forests have suffered disproportionately from coal mining-induced displacement and environmental impacts. The map in slide 3 shows India s coal reserves by state.  Korba a town in Chhattisgarh is home to three of India s largest mines which have all expanded rapidly in recent years.

The UK government s advisor on climate change has recommended that the country should make an international pledge to cut its greenhouse gas emissions to 81% below 1990 levels by 2035.The recommendation which is for the UK s next  nationally determined contribution  (NDC) under the Paris Agreement comes just weeks before the government is expected to announce its new target at the COP29 climate talks in Baku Azerbaijan  .  As shown in the chart above the target under the current UK s NDC is  at least 68%.  According to the Climate Change Committee (CCC) the new target would be  ambitious deliverable and consistent  with the UK s legally binding sixth carbon budget and provide a  credible contribution  towards limiting warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.Click the link in our bio for the full analysis.#UKpolicy #Emissions #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/10/carbonbrief_17903787201058040.jpeg,0.44329,2024-10-28 18:55:00,IMAGE,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_77.jpeg
Electric vehicle exports from China   including foreign brands such as Tesla   have increased 160-fold from 2019 to 2023 triggering fears of  overcapacity .As Chart 1  above shows in cumulative terms  the UK (red) has imported more Chinese EVs than any other country since 2019 though  the EU as a bloc is larger (dark blue). The other three largest importers since 2019 are  Brazil (yellow)  Australia (light blue) and  Thailand (mid blue).However despite the steady rise in the absolute value of Chinese EVs exported to the EU and UK the percentage share of exports to these two destinations has decreased significantly in recent years as the destinations for EV exports have diversified.As shown in Chart 2  the combined EU (dark blue) and UK (red) share of Chinese exports dropped from 75% in 2021 to around 40% in 2023.In contrast other export destinations   including Brazil (yellow) Australia (light blue) and Thailand (mid blue)   grew from about 22% in the first quarter of 2023 to 40% in the same period in 2024.

The  monsoon downpour  that triggered deadly landslides in  Kerala s Wayanad district last month was made 10% heavier by human-caused climate change a new rapid attribution study says.  The landslides followed an  exceptional spell of monsoon rain  on 30 July.   They have killed at least 230 people with more than one hundred people still missing and rescue operations ongoing.  A team of 24 researchers from India Malaysia US Sweden Netherlands and UK find that downpours of this intensity have already become 17% heavier in the last 45 years.  In a world where average global temperatures are 2C above pre-industrial levels the authors estimate that extreme single-day bursts of rainfall in Kerala could become a further 4% heavier potentially leading to even more catastrophic landslides.Click the link in our bio for more on the Kerala landslides.#Kerala #Monsoon #ClimateChange #ExtremeWeather,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/08/carbonbrief_18093046516456062.jpeg,0.42637,2024-08-23 17:51:00,IMAGE,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_79.jpeg

CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and cement will rise around 0.8% in 2024 reaching a record 37.4bn tonnes of CO2 according to the 2024 Global Carbon Budget report by the Global Carbon Project.  Total CO2 emissions   including both fossil and land-use emissions   will also set a new record reflecting a growth of 2% over 2023 levels.  Despite the increase in 2024 total CO2 emissions have largely plateaued over the past decade a sign that the world is making some modest progress tackling emissions.  But a flattening of emissions is far from what is needed to bring global emissions down to zero and stabilise global temperatures in-line with Paris Agreement goals.Click the link in our bio to read more from Dr Zeke Hausfather and Prof Pierre Friedlingstein.#CO2 #Emission #GlobalTemperatures #ParisAgreement,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/11/carbonbrief_18469707895005664.jpeg,0.38914,2024-11-18 14:29:00,IMAGE,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_82.jpeg
Nearly 60 countries have drastically scaled back their plans for building coal-fired power plants since the Paris Agreement in 2015.  This is according to figures released by Global Energy Monitor (GEM). The chart on slide 2 shows the change in proposed power capacity from 2015 in 2024 for those 60 countries. Red arrows indicate those that no longer have any plans to build coal power plants.As the chart illustrates some of the world s biggest coal users   including  Turkey  Vietnam and  Japan   have made significant cuts to their coal-power pipeline.35 nations   including  South Korea and  Germany   have eliminated coal from their plans entirely over the past decade.Even the world s largest coal consumers    China and  India   have both reduced their planned coal capacity by more than 60% over the same timeframe.Click the link in our bio to read the full analysis.#CoalPower #EnergyTransition #ParisAgreement #FossilFuels,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/04/carbonbrief_17926564307938110.jpeg,0.38918,2025-04-09 16:56:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_83.jpeg

The UK will miss the UN s deadline to publish a new national plan for how it will address nature loss ahead of the COP16 biodiversity summit in Colombia this month.In December 2023 at the COP28 climate summit in  Dubai the UK pledged to publish its nature strategy by May of this year.  The missed deadline comes after UK foreign secretary David Lammy said that the government would prioritise action against biodiversity loss describing it as a  more fundamental threat  than terrorism to the nation.  Although it will not now publish a new national plan before COP16 the UK did provide the UN with a technical document known as a national target submission in place of its strategy.Click the link in our bio for the full story.,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/10/carbonbrief_18039303095124977.jpeg,0.38576,2024-10-07 18:33:00,IMAGE,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_85.jpeg
UK government targets for  sustainable aviation fuels  (SAFs) will only cut emissions from the sector by 0.8% in 2040 Carbon Brief analysis shows.  As shown in the first chart emissions in 2025 are expected to be 36.0MtCO2e while 15 years later they are still forecast to be as high as 35.7MtCO2e.  This is because emissions savings from SAFs will be almost totally offset by a growth in flights leaving UK aviation emissions virtually unchanged between now and 2040.  The UK government has resisted pressure to curb the demand for air travel despite warnings from experts that such actions are vital for reducing aviation emissions.Meanwhile the only SAFs that are currently available in the UK are fuels made from used cooking oil and other waste oils which are collected from restaurants and factories. As illustrated in chart 2  waste oil-based SAF use is expected to rise around 15-fold from current levels within a decade.Chart 3  shows that as of 2023 waste cooking oil collected in the UK only accounted for 7% of the country s SAF production. And there is mounting evidence that the demand for imported cooking oil in the UK and Europe is being met with virgin palm oil that has been fraudulently passed off as waste.   This would cancel out the fuel s emissions savings due to the land clearances for oil palm plantations.Chart 4  shows that the UK s target for power-to-liquid fuels   an alternative to waste oil-based SAFs which can be made using green hydrogen and carbon captured from the air   are lower than EU targets.Click the link in our bio for the full analysis  #UK #Aviation #SAFs #Emissions #SustainableAviationFuel,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/05/carbonbrief_18045024904648408.jpeg,0.38238,2024-05-22 17:19:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_86.jpeg
The UK government has reclassified existing funds    1.72bn   pegged for development banks investment in foreign businesses and humanitarian aid as  climate finance .  Chart 1 visualises this reclassification showing the UK s annual international climate finance spend before and   forecasted   after the changes to the accounting methodology.  This is part of a wider revision of climate-finance accounting introduced by the government in 2023 to ensure the UK achieves its  11.6bn climate aid target.  As chart 2 shows for example nearly  500m of aid for war-torn and impoverished countries  including  Afghanistan  Yemen and  Somalia has been reclassified as  climate finance .  An extra  266m of development aid related to state-backed private sector investment has also been reclassified as climate finance. See chart 3.

The UK s right-leaning newspapers have unleashed a huge wave of editorials attacking energy secretary Ed Miliband since last year s general election Carbon Brief analysis reveals.  As chart 1  shows in the first half of 2024 newspapers published 16 editorials attacking Miliband. In the second half of the year since Labour s election win this increased to 45   roughly two every week.  Right-leaning outlets such as the Sun and the Daily Mail repeatedly called Miliband an  eco-zealot  a  madman  and a  hysterical eco-obsessive  due to his support for net-zero policies.  In 2024 unprecedented numbers of these editorials opposed climate action in general as well as renewable energy specifically. A record 44 of the editorials published in 2024 argued for less climate action. This is the third record-breaking year in a row for such editorials in UK newspapers as chart  2  above shows.  For a brief period peaking in 2020 these right-leaning publications appeared to have shifted in their attitudes. However as chart 3  shows since 2020 there has been a steep decline in support for climate action by these newspapers.

Glacier retreat is reshaping the Arctic. A new study finds that melting glaciers created 2500km of  new  coastline and 35  new  islands between 2000 and 2020.  The map above (slide 2) shows where the coastline was added (red) and lost (blue) due to changes in glacier positions over 2000-20. The yellow circles the total length of new coastline added in different regions where larger circles indicate greater additions.  The researchers link the acceleration in glacier melt to warmer ocean and air temperatures.  They also warn that the freshly revealed coastlines are more prone to landslides which may in turn create  dangerous tsunamis  that pose risks to human life and infrastructure.Click the link in our bio for more on the Arctic s glacier retreat.#GlobalWarming #Arctic #ExtremeTemperatures #OceanWarming,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/04/carbonbrief_17880237147271315.jpeg,0.37226,2025-04-04 16:31:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_90.jpeg

Who profits from genetic data derived from biodiversity   and who gets left out? A new global fund aims to change that.  At COP16 countries agreed to the first-ever mechanism requiring companies that use digital sequence information (DSI) to contribute to biodiversity conservation. The fund officially opens on 25 February.  Companies use DSI to develop products like medicines cosmetics and drought-resistant cropsoften without compensating the global-south nations and Indigenous communities where the genetic material originated. The new fund is a step toward fairness but challenges remain. Contributions are voluntary and much depends on whether national laws push companies to pay in.  The infographic above explains via an illustrative journey how gene data from biodiversity makes its way to products and consumers and how these benefits could flow to communities and protect ecosystems.Click the link in our bio to learn more about the DSI fund.  koylabear   kerryanncleaver #Biodiversity #COP16 #DSI #NatureFund,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/02/carbonbrief_18001859522565586.jpeg,0.32488,2025-02-24 17:48:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_94.jpeg
New Carbon Brief analysis shows that the UK s Labour government could approve 13 new  oil and gas projects in the North Sea with the fuel produced emitting 350m tonnes of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e) if burned.This is equivalent to the annual emissions of 111 of the world s lowest-emitting countries which have a combined population of 649 million.Although the Labour government has ruled out issuing new oil and gas licences for the North Sea it has not ruled out approving projects that already have a licence but have not yet received consent to begin development.

The agreement comes amid a shaky geopolitical landscape with COP16 president Susana Muhamad earning a standing ovation for guiding negotiations to a consensus.  But the challenge ahead is steep. Some three-quarters of nations have yet to submit their biodiversity plans and over half of those that have submitted do not commit to protecting 30% of land and seas by 2030.Click the link in our bio to read Carbon Brief s in-depth explainer of the summit s key outcomes.

French citizens will go to the polls for the final round of its legislative elections this Sunday. The first round took place on 30 June and placed Le Pen s far-right party National Rally (Rassemblement National or RN) in the lead. Under France s electoral system candidates who get the most votes during the second round will be elected as deputies (members of parliament). Macron will then have to appoint a prime minister taking into account the results of the elections. Jordan Bardella is leading RN s campaign and is likely to take the job of PM if they win. However the final outcome of the elections is still highly uncertain as third-placed candidates have pulled out to try and block the far-right s gains. Carbon Brief has tracked the commitments made by each of the main party alliances in their election manifestos across a range of issues related to climate and energy.

On 20 June the UK Supreme Court issued a majority judgment ruling that Surrey County Council acted unlawfully by granting planning permission for a new oil project in Horse Hill. The court argued that councillors did not consider the climate impact from burning the fuel.  The ruling was the result of a years-long legal attempt by community and environmental groups to challenge the new oil project and has implications for all new fossil fuel projects in the UK.Swipe to learn more about the implications and click the link in our bio for our full report.#HorseHill #ClimateChange #FossilFuel #UKpolicy,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/07/carbonbrief_17867364828160309.jpeg,0.24364,2024-07-23 18:05:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_106.jpeg
The COP16 biodiversity summit came to an abrupt halt on Saturday after countries failed to reach consensus on the creation of a new fund during a mammoth 10-hour final plenary session.  Countries debated through the night in Cali Colombia in an attempt to get through the many items on COP16 s agenda.  But as the talks dragged on into Saturday morning a large number of developing-country delegates were forced to catch flights home leaving parties without the  quorum  needed to reach consensus on key issues.  Nations did however find consensus in some areas such as a new permanent body for Indigenous peoples and a new benefit-sharing mechanism for genetic resources.

Researchers from the HABITABLE Project are interviewing thousands of people to understand the links between climate change impacts migration and displacement patterns.  Carbon Brief s science writer Ayesha Tandon joined researchers in four villages in Thailand s Chiang Rai province to learn more about their perceptions of climate change and migration.  The villagers rarely bring up climate change unprompted but they are all highly attuned to changes in local temperature and rainfall patterns   especially regarding the nuanced changes in weather that impact their crops.   In one village as crop yields drop villagers in their 20s and 30s are leaving to find better-paid work. They often send money back home to their parents and children but the  missing generation  can be detrimental for the people left behind.Swipe across to learn more about how climate change is affecting rural Thai villages and how the farmers perceive these changes.

Billions of dollars of foreign aid have been reclassified as  climate finance  suggests new analysis conducted by the Center for Global Development (cgdev_ ).  This is despite the widespread expectation that wealthy countries should provide climate finance that is  new and additional . Such accounting changes could allow some developed countries to reach their climate targets even while slashing their wider aid budgets.  Chart 1  shows that while the overall aid budget grew in 2022 due partly to new aid for Ukraine and more spending on housing refugees existing bilateral development aid fell in 2022.  This reclassification has already enabled developed nations achieve their goal of raising $100bn in climate aid for developing countries in 2022 albeit two years after the deadline.  As shown in Chart 2  the uptick in climate finance was driven by record increases in spending both bilaterally   directly from country-to-country   and via multilateral development banks and funds.

Of course there s a backlash from the fossil fuel industry including some car companies  says Greg Jackson  because even today EVs have taken 1.8 million barrels of oil off the road per day.That s enough that the global oil industry is suddenly seeing what used to look like a minor inconvenience in the future as a real and present danger. Jackson is the founder and CEO of octopusenergy a global energy and technology company headquartered in London.He recently sat down with Carbon Brief to talk about a range of issues including:  the UK s energy transition  the upcoming UK general election  misinformation in the media  the cost of hydrogen for heating  the cost of renewables  the psychology of climate changeClick the link in our bio to see the whole conversation.#GregJackson #OctopusEnergy #EnergyTransition #Renewables,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/05/carbonbrief_18027428873080818.jpeg,0.0846,2024-05-17 12:19:00,reel,Posts_carbonbrief_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_2db6 6_CLEANED_117.jpeg
