The fashion industry especially fast fashion has operated with little oversight for decades leading to severe environmental damage from pollution to deforestation and oceanic microplastic contamination. Human rights abuses like labor exploitation and unsafe working conditions are rampant across supply chains.  The average person buys 53 new pieces of clothing every year enough to dress the next six generations. Let that sink in.Whats missing?

When governments fall short leaders like Michael Bloomberg step up.   By funding the U.N. climate body (UNFCCC) after Trump s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement Bloomberg ensures that vital climate talks and progress continue. We deeply appreciate the generous support from Bloomberg Philanthropies and the leadership shown by Mike Bloomberg  said Simon Stiell U.N. climate chief. Last year Bloomberg Philanthropies contributed $4.5 million to the UNFCCC supporting a core budget of 240 million euros for 2024-2025. As U.S. federal action falters Bloomberg s leadership highlights the power of private philanthropy to fill the gap and keep global climate goals alive. This isnt just about funding its about action.

Trump s decision to reverse the phase-out of plastic straws for paper alternatives isn t just environmentally reckless it s a direct threat to human health.  Plastic straws contribute to the 8 million tons of plastic waste polluting our oceans each year threatening marine life and ecosystems. But the damage doesn t stop at wildlife microplastics have made their way into our water food and even our bodies. A study in Nature Medicine found elevated concentrations of microplastics in human brains raising alarms about their potential link to neurological diseases. Research from the University of New Mexico Health Sciences reveals brain plastic levels have surged by 50% over the past 8 years with dementia patients showing up to 10 times the levels found in others. There s enough plastic in our brains to form a straw. As toxicologist Matthew Campen said  These nanomaterials could interfere with brain connections and may even contribute to dementia.By promoting plastic straws Trump is ignoring science and prioritizing convenience over public health. The risks are real and this decision threatens future generations. At this point his brain should come with a BPA warning  Take action sign the Global Plastics Treaty petition through the link in our bio,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/02/earthdaynetwork_18083995183600075.jpeg,0.66161,2025-02-11 00:54:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_earthdaynetwork_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_3500_CLEANED_7.jpeg

President Biden has permanently banned offshore oil and gas drilling in 625 million acres of U.S. ocean protecting Atlantic Pacific and Gulf Coast ecosystems.

As the climate crisis worsens Big Oil is doubling down spending billions to secure fossil fuel production into the 2030s. ExxonMobil and Chevron made massive acquisitions while ignoring renewable energy investment and focusing on oil and gas.Here s the kicker: Taxpayers are footing the bill for new oil wells and the cleanup of pollution left behind. Big Oil prioritizes profits over the planet and your future.  In 2023 Big Oil spent $113.8 billion on stock buybacks during the hottest year on record while global temperatures surpassed 1.5 C for the first time.This isn t just a tragedy it s a crime. Big Oil knew but chose to ignore the warnings. Now we re left with the consequences.Even if you don t believe in climate change your tax dollars are funding the cleanup.  Its time for change.

California s wildfires are becoming longer more extreme and less predictable fueled by climate change and the burning of fossil fuels. The connection is clear: rising global temperatures are intensifying fire weather conditions leaving communities vulnerable.Our hearts are with the L.A. community where over 3000 acres have been devastated by wildfires driven by rare winds and extreme dryness. Thousands have been forced to evacuate and heroic firefighters are risking everything to protect lives and homes.Climate change isn t just a distant problem it s a series of disasters coming closer to all of us.

EARTHDAY.ORG pays tribute to the extraordinary life of President Jimmy Carter who will be laid to rest on January 9 2025. Carter s lifelong commitment to peace and his visionary leadership on renewable energy leave a lasting impact. His early advocacy for solar energy resonates deeply with our mission  says Kathleen Rogers President of EARTHDAY.ORG noting its alignment with the 2025 Earth Day theme Our Power Our Planet.Amid the 1970s energy crisis Carter boldly championed renewables aiming for 20% of U.S. energy from renewable sources by 2000.  If he d had a second term our climate and prosperity would look very different today  recalls Denis Hayes Earth Day s first organizer.We honor his vision for a cleaner future and extend condolences to his family.

BREAKING: New York Governor Kathy Hochul faces MAGA backlash after signing a historic law holding fossil fuel companies accountable for climate damages.The new legislation requires major polluters those responsible for the majority of emissions between 2000 and 2018 to pay roughly $3 billion annually for the next 25 years to fund climate recovery efforts.State Senator Liz Krueger a lead sponsor of the bill called it a  shot heard  round the world. For years courts dismissed climate lawsuits against Big Oil saying lawmakers should decide. Now the New York State Legislature the world s 10th largest economy has acted. We ve made it clear: those most responsible for the climate crisis must help clean up the damage  Krueger said.New York now joins Vermont as the second state to enact such legislation. With New York s influence this decision could have ripple effects far beyond the state.Local and state action matters.

Climate change isn t some distant threat it s hitting home hard.  Since 2018 over 1.9M home insurance contracts have been dropped as wildfires hurricanes and other climate disasters make areas too risky for insurers. The U.S. now faces 4x more billion-dollar disasters than 40 years ago. In 2023 alone weather-related damages exceeded $100B.  The Ripple Effects: No insurance = no mortgage locking young people out of homeownership. Dropped policies are spreading nationwide from Florida to California and Hawaii. Property values plummet slashing funding for schools police and essential services.  The Cost of Inaction: State-run high-risk pools offer limited coverage at exorbitant premiums. Experts warn this crisis could spark an economic collapse.Insurers are sounding the alarm will we listen?PS: The NY Times map doubles as both a nonrenewable energy rate map and a climate disaster map    Take action today to safeguard your home and community!

They have known all along The processed food filling our shelves is packed with toxic chemicals that are making us sick.A new Consumer Reports study tested everyday foods and found nearly all contained bisphenols and phthalates harmful chemicals linked to serious health risks.The biggest culprits?  Fast food (McDonald s Wendy s Burger King Chipotle)  Baby formula & food (Similac Gerber Beech-Nut)  Kids  favorites (Juicy Juice Cheerios Annie s Chef Boyardee + more)  Seafood (Chicken of the Sea even salmon thanks to plastic pollution)These chemicals don t just affect us they impact developing babies before birth contributing to infertility birth defects and premature birth.And the damage doesn t stop there.Children are being exposed to chemicals linked to cancer obesity diabetes and neurological disorders through foods marketed directly to them. These toxins don t just pass through our system they accumulate in our brains.New research shows microplastics are now found in human brain tissue with dementia patients showing even higher levels. At the same time dementia rates are projected to double by 2060.This is not normal.

The European Commission has just banned Bisphenol A (BPA) in food contact materials like can coatings and plastic bottles. This bold step aligns with the latest scientific findings aiming to protect public health by reducing exposure to harmful chemicals. BPA disrupts the endocrine system posing significant health risks and the EU will phase it out over the next 18 months.  Meanwhile the US has recently shifted its stance on the global plastics treaty. While the Biden administration initially supported limits on plastic production they ve now backed away from mandatory caps favoring a more flexible approach with voluntary national targets. This shift has sparked concern among environmental advocates who fear it could weaken efforts to tackle plastic pollution on a global scale.  The EU is leading the charge on both plastic pollution and chemical safety its time the US follows suit and takes stronger action for both our health and the planet!

Environmental justice must be at the center of the clean energy transition. Many communities especially those long reliant on coal oil and gas are already burdened by pollution poor health and economic instability. Nearly 64 million people live in these areas with 45% designated as disadvantaged due to excessive pollution and limited resources.Fossil fuel facilities have left lasting health impacts from heart disease to asthma. A just transition means prioritizing these communities not just for economic support but for the clean air and water they ve long been denied.Take action now: Sign the renewable energy petition and join us for Earth Day 2025 to fight for a cleaner more equitable future.#blackhistorymonth #advocacy #diversity #environmentalhealth #health #toxic,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/02/earthdaynetwork_18285179032220380.jpeg,0.13908,2025-02-03 22:21:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_earthdaynetwork_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_3500_CLEANED_40.jpeg

Did you know that producing just one liter of bottled water in the U.S. consumes more than half a liter of oil?  In 2006 producing plastic for bottled water in the U.S. consumed approximately 17 million barrels of oil enough energy to fuel over 1 million cars for a year.   (Source: Pacific Institute)Since then the bottled water industry has grown significantly. From 2010 to 2020 market consumption increased by 73% with consumption projected to rise from 350 billion liters in 2021 to 460 billion liters by 2025. With this increase energy consumption for bottled water production has likely surged as well.The real cost of convenience is higher than you think.

The Clean Energy Revolution Is Here And It s Moving FastFor decades the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington State was one of the most contaminated sites in the U.S. a relic of the nation s nuclear weapons program. Now it s set to become the country s largest solar farm a powerful symbol of how the clean energy transition is not just possible but already happening.With 3.45 million solar panels planned this massive project will generate up to 2000 megawatts of electricity enough to power Seattle San Francisco and Denver combined. It will also include large-scale battery storage doubling its impact and making it a key player in the shift toward a reliable renewable energy grid.The best part? This isn t just about energy it s about jobs innovation and economic opportunity. The project will create thousands of jobs attract clean tech investments and prove that repurposing land for renewables is a scalable forward-thinking solution.While political uncertainty looms over clean energy policy the reality is clear: Renewables have already left the station. The demand for clean power is skyrocketing driven by technological advancements and public pressure for a sustainable future. Major companies entire cities and even historically contaminated sites are embracing the shift because the future is renewable and it s happening now.The world is at a tipping point. This Earth Day let s harness Our Power Our Planet and push even harder for a clean energy future.Earth day 2025 link in our bio   #OurPowerOurPlanet #RenewableEnergyNow #EarthActionDay #EarthDay2025 #EarthDay55 #positivenews #solar #renewables,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/03/earthdaynetwork_18006851660726016.jpeg,0.11722,2025-03-21 15:19:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_earthdaynetwork_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_3500_CLEANED_44.jpeg
