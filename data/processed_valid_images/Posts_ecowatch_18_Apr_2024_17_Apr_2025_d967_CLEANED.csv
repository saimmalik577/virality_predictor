Nature has rights!  Aruba has drafted a constitutional amendment that would make it the second country in the world to recognize that nature has inherent rights. The amendment also affirms that people are entitled to a  clean healthy and sustainable environment . The draft bill was announced by the country s nature minister Ursell Arends earlier this month. It would require the government to  take preventive measures to protect against the negative consequences of climate change. If the amendment is approved Aruba will be the second nation in the world after Ecuador to recognize the rights of nature in its constitution. About 30 countries   including Uganda Bolivia and Spain   have recognized the inherent rights of particular species or ecosystems.This potential amendment will also be the first time Aruba has altered its constitution since 1986. Aruba s constitutional amendment would also require that the government periodically look at the state of the environment and issue reports every five years.Plastic pollution overfishing and waste generated in great part by visitors are some of the environmental impacts facing the small island nation. Aruba is also experiencing increasing sea level rise coastal erosion and ocean acidification due to climate change.

Prime Minister of Greece Kyriakos Mitsotakis has announced plans to invest 780 million euros (about $829 million) for marine conservation and pollution cleanup. The country will pursue 21 marine conservation initiatives with the money.As reported by Reuters some of the initiatives will include the development of two marine parks: one will be located in the Ionian Sea and the other park will be established in the Aegean Sea. The exact borders will be determined following a scientific review expected to be complete by 2025. The parks will cover about 32% of the country s waters.With 29417 islands and over 20700 kilometers (over 12862 miles) of coastline Greece relies on the seas surrounding its islands. Marine conservation is important for the country s culture and economy but Mitsotakis also noted that efforts to protect the seas around Greece will contribute to the country s efforts to curb the effects of climate change.Greece plans to address some of these ocean conservation and climate concerns through Marine Protected Areas sustainable fisheries offshore wind development enhanced maritime security decarbonization of maritime transportation and sustainable tourism models. Greece also plans to reduce plastic pollution by 50% and microplastic pollution by 30% by the end of this decade.  Link in bio.

California is tackling the problem of textile and fashion waste with the country s first law that requires clothing companies to implement a recycling system for the garments they sell.Governor Gavin Newsom recently signed SB 707 the Responsible Textile Recovery Act. The new law requires a clothing apparel and textile extended producer responsibility (EPR) program as defined by lawmakers. The landmark bill passed with wide support from state legislators.Fashion consumers in California will now have the option of bringing damaged and unwanted clothing and other textiles to collection sites   including thrift stores and charities   to be sorted and recycled.The new law mandates that producers of clothing bedding towels and upholstery administer and fund the repair reuse and recycling of their products statewide.

Without greater action the planet will warm as much as 3.1 degrees Celsius by the end of the century according to the latest United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report. In the coming round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) countries must commit to slashing their collective yearly greenhouse gas emissions by 42 percent by the end of the decade and by 57 percent by 2035 a press release from UNEP said.Otherwise the annual report says the chance of meeting the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average will disappear within a few years.The report found that failing to increase the ambition of new NDCs and immediately starting to deliver on them would place the planet on a course for an increase in temperature from 2.6 to 3.1 degrees Celsius this century bringing debilitating impacts to people the environment and economies.The report also looked at what would be needed to limit global heating to less than two degrees Celsius. For this to be possible emissions would need to fall by 28 percent by the end of the decade and 37 percent by 2035 compared to 2019 levels.

Mexico City could be just weeks away from Day Zero the day when the city runs out of water supplied by the Cutzamala water system. Water reservoirs in the city recently hit historic lows and amid ongoing drought conditions and a heat dome the city could face Day Zero by June 26  The Cutzamala water system supplies about 25% of Mexico City s water while about 60% comes from underground aquifers that are over-exploited and have had issues dating back to the 16th century.As of March 2024 the Cutzamala water system reached a historic low of about 38% capacity.Starting October 2023 Mexico City began tightening the amount of water supplied by the Cutzamala system and reducing the flow rate. The city has also called on citizens to drastically cut back on water usage.However while water conservation by the public has helped in similar crises including one made famous in Cape Town South Africa in 2018 Mexico City also faces major water losses from its infrastructure. As Fast Company reported about 40% of the city s water is lost through leaks and additional water is lost to theft as organized crime groups steal public water for agricultural use or to resell back to the public at inflated rates.Without rain Day Zero is expected to come by June 26.The rainy season is expected to begin in June. But many citizens have already reported water shortages and some neighborhoods have experienced water scarcity for years.  Link in bio.

Los Angeles County filed a lawsuit against PepsiCo and Coca-Cola on October 30 arguing that the companies misled the public on product recyclability and the impact of plastic pollution on the environment.According to the lawsuit as documented by Reuters the county is filing a suit for public nuisance and violations of unfair competition law and false advertising law and is seeking injunctive relief restitution abatement and civil penalties.In the lawsuit the county argues that PepsiCo and Coca-Cola were intentionally misleading about the recyclability of plastic beverage containers and the lawsuit alleges that the companies knew that the plastic beverage containers could not be thrown out or recycled without impacting the environment. The county also noted that making throwing out and recycling plastic all still contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and negatively impact the environment.According to Break Free From Plastic s 2023 Global Brand Audit which was released in February 2024 Coca-Cola is the top plastic polluter globally a position it has held for six consecutive years based on the audit. The lawsuit also stated that these two companies are some of the world s top plastic polluters and alleges their plastic bottles have littered the county accumulating on land and in waterways to threaten wildlife and public health and costing the county resources to clean up the mess.

A new report has found that climate lawsuits being filed against companies are on the rise all over the world and most of them have been successful  The report by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) said that roughly 230 climate cases have been brought against trade associations and corporations since 2015 more than two-thirds of which have been filed since 2020.One of the fastest growing types of litigation concerns  climate washing.  According to the report 47 of these lawsuits were filed against governments and companies last year.The report stated that there had been  more than 140 such cases filed to date on climate washing making this one of the most rapidly expanding areas of litigation  a press release from LSE said. Of the almost 140 climate-washing cases between 2016 and 2023 77 had reached official decisions with 54 being found in favor of the claimant.Most climate cases that have been filed in the past have been against governments. In the United States 15 percent of climate cases filed in 2023 were against companies while 40 percent of cases in the rest of the world involved companies.The report s analysis was based on more than 2600 climate cases compiled by Columbia Law School s Sabin Center for Climate Change. Approximately 70 percent of these lawsuits have been filed since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015 with 233 having been filed in 2023.

Oxygen concentrations in the waters of our planet are rapidly decreasing threatening ecosystems as well as the livelihoods of many.In a new study an international team of researchers are calling for oxygen loss in bodies of water to be recognized as a planetary boundary so that it can be more effectively addressed. As oxygen is a fundamental requirement of all life on Earth oxygen loss in water   deoxygenation   threatens all living creatures.If critical thresholds of global scale processes known as  planetary boundaries  are crossed the risk of abrupt large-scale or irreversible changes to the environment    tipping points    increases jeopardizing our planet s resilience.The study s authors argue that aquatic deoxygenation responds to and regulates the processes of the nine established planetary boundaries which include climate change biodiversity loss and land use change.Since 1980 reservoirs and lakes have had oxygen losses of 18.6 and 5.5 percent respectively. The ocean has experienced roughly a two percent oxygen loss since 1960 which represents an extensive amount due to its enormous volume.The authors of the study warned that the planet is approaching critical aquatic deoxygenation thresholds that will eventually impact several other planetary boundaries.

Indigenous leaders of New Zealand Tonga French Polynesia and the Cook Islands signed a treaty that recognizes whales as legal persons  For many Indigenous groups across Polynesia whales hold an ancient sacredness and spirit that connects all life. Whales   or tohor  as M ori call them   guided their ancestors across the Pacific Ocean. Today those groups consider themselves to be guardians for the largest animals under the sea.But as of recent whales are not simply animals in this region and instead are viewed as legal persons. Conservationists hope this will lead to legal protections. A number of types of whales are found in the Pacific Ocean including blue gray minke sperm southern right and of particular importance to M ori humpback. And while there is some protection for the mammals within the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary where the International Whaling Commission has banned all types of commercial whaling there is no formal legislation.Proposed legislation from this treaty would be built around several pillars: monitoring penalties for killing whales and even whale insurance. A $100 million fund will back the initiative. : brynnerardin.#ecowatchers #climatenews #climatechange #globalwarming #whales #personhood #legislation #polynesia #indigenous #ocean,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/06/ecowatch_18254651473221029.jpeg,0.4879,2024-06-04 18:30:00,reel,Posts_ecowatch_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_d967_CLEANED_9.jpeg
According to a new paper pharmaceutical pollution is posing new dangers to wildlife and humans will need to develop more eco-friendly medications to preserve ecosystems. The specific effects that human drugs can have on wildlife has been well documented. One study found that when exposed to antidepressants present in their habitat crayfish spent more time seeking food which could put them in greater danger from predators. Another study found signs of methamphetamine addiction in trout that were exposed to water polluted with these drugs. A study of Florida s waterways revealed 58 different kinds of prescription drugs present in 93 bonefish with a single fish having as many as 17 different drugs present.There are a wide variety of drugs entering the environment from legal drugs and prescription medications like caffeine and antidepressants to illegal drugs such as methamphetamine and cocaine. Not only can these drugs lead to behavioral changes in wildlife but they can also leach into groundwater used for drinking water.The paper cited a recent study that looked at pollution of active pharmaceutical ingredients worldwide. In that study researchers analyzed 61 drugs in samples of river water from 1052 sites in 104 countries and 43% of sites had at least one drug present at levels higher than ecological safety limits.The authors of the paper are urging scientists to develop  greener  drugs that will still be effective for humans but will be safer for wildlife. The recommended updates include developing drugs that more quickly and fully biodegrade as well as updating wastewater treatment infrastructure so that it can remove pharmaceutical pollutants before they reach the environment.

A major win for the beaches found alongside the UK coast! A new report from Marine Conservation Society has determined an 80% decline in the amount of plastic bags found washed up on beaches in the past 10 years. The report links the decline in plastic bag waste to the enacting of fees for single-use plastic bags at large supermarket retailers in 2015.As the Centre for Public Impact reported England first issued a law requiring retailers with 250 or more full-time employees to charge at least 5 pence per each single-use plastic bag. Fees typically range between 5 and 25 pence per bag. In 2023 the UK government shared a report that found plastic bag usage at major supermarkets declined by 98% from 2014 to 2023.Although the Marine Conservation Society praised the decline of plastic bags washing up on beaches since the bag fees were initiated the organization noted that more work is needed to further reduce plastic bag pollution along with other forms of waste. Recent beach surveys from Marine Conservation Society found an increase in drinks-related plastic litter and an overall 1.2% increase in plastic litter across UK beaches despite the decline in plastic bag litter.

Alaska is known for its natural beauty and stunning landscapes teeming with vast wilderness and abundant wildlife.But staining the landscape is a strange phenomenon: Dozens of the most remote rivers and streams in the Land of the Midnight Sun are turning from clear blue to cloudy orange. New research has found that the discoloration could be from the exposure of minerals from thawing permafrost.For the first time researchers have sampled and documented some of these degraded waterways including 75 locations across part of the Brooks Range in northern Alaska. The researchers said that as the climate continues to be affected by global heating these contaminated rivers and streams could seriously impact fisheries and drinking water in Arctic watersheds.The affected rivers are located on federal lands   including Kobuk Valley and Gates of the Arctic National Parks   managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service Bureau of Land Management and NPS. The river and stream-staining minerals can affect the health of fish and in turn the humans who consume them.The problem of Alaska s rusting rivers is increasing. Healthy areas are turning into degraded habitats with less fish and invertebrates. Rural communities that rely on the rivers for their drinking water may need to use treatment methods eventually while fishing stocks could also be affected.

What was once a landfill in the town of Fort Edward New York has now been transformed into a community solar project that will power hundreds of local households with clean energy  The project a collaboration between Kendall Sustainable Infrastructure AC Power and GreenSpark Solar turned the former landfill site into a 7 megawatt solar project spanning a 58-acre lot.According to a press release from AC Power the new solar community site will provide power to more than 800 households.A landfill from 1969 to 1991 the site became what AC Power described as an  environmental burden  until it was capped and its hazardous waste was cleaned up. By 2019 the town began accepting proposals from developers over what to do with the empty site.According to the project developers and owners the project will provide more affordable clean energy to Fort Edward while also contributing toward New York s goals for a clean energy transition including installing 3000 megawatts of clean energy by 2030 and reaching zero-emissions electricity by 2040.As explained by the U.S. Department of Energy community solar projects work by collecting solar energy at one site and sharing the energy to local residents and businesses who pay a subscription fee. This makes solar energy more accessible to homes and businesses that may not be able to install their own solar panels and can help reduce energy bills and make the community more resilient against power outages.The companies behind the Fort Edward solar project are also working on a similar brownfield redevelopment project in Queensbury New York that will turn a former factory site into a 6 megawatt solar site.

The climate crisis is not only having an impact on temperatures weather and environment it s also affecting the length of a day. Global heating is causing polar ice to melt which is altering how fast Earth rotates making each day longer. It is a shift that will accelerate as long as humans continue to burn fossil fuels that produce planet-warming greenhouse gases.The length of a day is changing by milliseconds but it is enough to potentially interfere with technologies that depend on exact timekeeping such as GPS navigation financial transactions and the internet.As Earth warms and ice sheets and glaciers melt the meltwater flows toward the equator changing the shape of the planet. It becomes flatter at the poles and bulges at the middle slowing down its rotation. In addition the moon s gravitational pull on the planet s land and oceans has been causing Earth s day to become steadily longer over geological time. While humans may not physically perceive the change it can interfere with systems that rely on atomic time which is extremely precise and based on specific atoms  frequency - thus still having an overall impact on our daily lives.

The planet is currently experiencing its fourth global coral bleaching event on record affecting most of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). It is the second mass bleaching in the past decade  Across the Pacific Atlantic and Indian Ocean basins heat stress at levels high enough to cause bleaching has been extensive as monitored remotely by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) s Coral Reef Watch (CRW).CRW bases its sea surface temperature data on information gathered from NOAA and partner satellites from 1985 to the present.For a bleaching event to be  global  there must be significant bleaching in the three ocean basins over a one-year period. Since February 2023 mass bleaching has been detected among reefs in at least 54 nations and territories CRW said.Bleaching occurs when extreme water temperatures trigger corals to expel the vibrant algae that live in a symbiotic relationship with them providing the corals with nutrients.As with the current global bleaching event the other three   1998 2010 and 2014 to 2017   happened at the same time as the El Ni o climate pattern known to cause warmer sea surface temperatures. The combination of El Ni o and climate change have resulted in ocean temperatures breaking long-standing records over the past year.Mass coral reef bleaching has been recorded throughout the tropics since early last year including in Florida the Caribbean the eastern Tropical Pacific the GBR Brazil the Red Sea Persian Gulf the Gulf of Aden and the South Pacific.

Scientists have discovered that rather than competing with other organisms the ancient resilience of ferns may facilitate and ease the path of other plants and animals in reestablishing themselves in damaged landscapes.The NASA-supported study looked at the recovery of biospheres following major disasters like wildfires using a  facilitative  framework   one where organisms  actions help each other   instead of the  competition-based  framework scientists have historically relied upon a press release from NASA said.Following major upheaval events ferns are frequently one of first-seen plants to reestablish themselves. The reason for this has been said to be because the large amounts of spores ferns produce are widely distributed by the wind. This  competitive  success has been used as a foundation of ecological theories for how recolonization happens following disasters.Recently however research has demonstrated that competition is not the only means of recovery. Facilitation between ferns and surrounding species has been found to play a critical role. The study s authors believe positive interactions within ecosystems need to be reexamined instead of defaulting to a competition-based framework.

A network of universities across Europe has launched an initiative to train medical students on climate change-related illnesses as well as provide education on more sustainable healthcare.The initiative includes 25 universities that have formed the European Network on Climate & Health Education (ENCHE) which will incorporate climate change education into the existing curriculum. The goal is to better prepare students to treat humans facing health disparities linked to climate change as well as to improve the sustainability of the healthcare system.The network will be led by the University of Glasgow and supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and universities from Belgium France Germany Ireland Italy Poland Portugal Slovenia Sweden Spain Switzerland and the UK will be involved in ENCHE.ENCHE has a goal to train 10000 or more medical students on treating climate change health impacts in the first three years of the program. According to the University of Glasgow there is not a consistent curriculum in medical schools that teaches on the links between climate change and health impacts.This training could help save many more lives as human health becomes increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

EcoWatch Lead Media Producer brynnerardin had the pleasure of interviewing National Geographic Photographer brianskerry on his newest project Sea Change: The Gulf of Maine. Sea Change is produced by Skerry a native New Englander and focuses of the rich environment of the Gulf of Maine and the threat that climate change is playing on this marine ecosystem and the millions of people who depend on it. Tune in to learn more about the Gulf of Maine the importance of Marine Reserves how Skerry s work as a National Geographic Photographer has shaped him into the producer he is today and how we are all more connected to the ocean than we think. A series on the importance of hope and resiliency this is a must watch!Sea Change is a three-part documentary series that premieres tonight July 24th at 10pm EST on PBS the PBS App and NOVA on Youtube.,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/07/ecowatch_18297286237164516.jpeg,0.35258,2024-07-24 17:54:00,reel,Posts_ecowatch_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_d967_CLEANED_19.jpeg
For the first time the amount of aquatic life   such as fish clams and shrimp   that was farmed outpaced wild-caught aquatic life in 2022 according to the United Nations s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).In the UN s latest The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture report it found that aquaculture or farmed aquatic life produced 130.9 million metric tons in 2022. By comparison the same year saw 92.3 million metric tons of aquatic life products from global capture fisheries. Inland fisheries generated 11.3 million metric tons while marine capture produced 81 million metric tons.According to the UN this is the first time that aquaculture production has outpaced capture fisheries although it said that both are essential for feeding the global population.In total fisheries and aquaculture production produced 223.2 million metric tons of aquatic life most of which (185.4 million metric tons) was animals. About 37.8 million metric tons produced were algae which is expected to be an important food source for the growing human population by 2050.The UN has noted that the rise in farmed fishing is a way to reduce food insecurity as well as a way to minimize overfishing and unsustainable practices in the capture fishing industry especially as the report predicted a 10% increase in aquatic animal production by 2032 to meet an estimated 12% increase in demand for consumption.But aquaculture is not without its environmental concerns. As KQED reported aquaculture can pollute waterways from the excess nutrients and fecal waste generated in aquatic farms. For larger fish smaller fish may still be wild-caught to feed the farmed fish. Farmed fish can also be vulnerable to disease transmission and they may pass those illnesses on to wild fish the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported.  Link in bio.

New research has found that the tropical Indian Ocean is warming at an unprecedented rate that could speed up this century if human-produced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are not reduced right away  The accelerated temperature increase could have significant impacts on biodiversity   particularly coral reefs   as well as have wide-ranging socioeconomic effects.According to a recent study the temperature of the planet s third-largest ocean experienced a basin-wide warming increase from 1871 to 2020. The average sea surface temperature in the 1870s was 79.6 degrees Fahrenheit but had increased to 81 degrees Fahrenheit by the 2010s.Ocean surface warming in the Indian Ocean   coupled with heat built up in the first 6561.7 feet below   can have substantial effects on the region s monsoon season. The weather pattern brings roughly 70 percent of India s yearly rainfall while affecting climate in other South Asian nations.The increased warming could also cause more intense and frequent extreme weather like flooding and tropical cyclones in addition to sea level rise from thermal expansion in the 40 countries that border the Indian Ocean. Thermal expansion is responsible for more than 50 percent of sea level rise exceeding that caused by sea ice and glacial melt.Marine heat waves can lead to coral bleaching kelp forest degradation and seagrass loss. They can also contribute to the rapid intensification of tropical cyclones.

Researchers have found promising signs for a possible increase of Antarctic blue whales based on surveys spanning from 2006 to 2021  A team of scientists analyzed data they collected from seven acoustic surveys conducted in the Antarctic region over the 15-year timespan. They used  sonobuoys  to detect marine sounds and ultimately gathered about 3900 hours  worth of sounds to review. In the analysis the researchers specifically sought out calls of Antarctic blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia) which are the largest animals on the planet but are currently critically endangered according to the IUCN Red List.The researchers explained that the whales  song sounds are considered a 3-unit vocalization (written as A B and C throughout the study) and together the full call is referenced as the Z-call.They found that Unit A calls were the most widely distributed in the recordings from the sonobuoys. Unit A calls and Z-calls were more prominent in late summer and early fall. D-calls or non-song calls were detected most in the summer during the feeding season.According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Antarctic blue whales are not just the largest animal on the planet but also the loudest. Their calls can reach about 188 decibels making them louder than a jet engine and they can be heard hundreds of miles away. This makes it easier and more cost-effective for researchers to use audio to study the whales.While the findings reveal regular calls from the whales and give hope for a potential increase in the population the study authors emphasized that more research is needed to determine whether that means the whale population is actually rebounding.

A  supermajority    85 percent   of young Americans polled feel distressed about human-caused climate change and and similar percentages want stronger action from corporations and the government.In the survey   the largest of its kind   most of the 16000 respondents aged 16 to 25 from every state in the country said they were worried about the impact climate change was having on humans and the planet. More than 60 percent of those surveyed said they felt powerlessness anxiety fear sadness and anger due to the climate crisis with high levels of concern regardless of political affiliation. The strong emotional response to the climate crisis did come with a hearty desire for action. More than two thirds of respondents want the government of the United States and other nations to prepare for and prevent the worst effects of global heating.Researchers say young people do not feel that the climate crisis is being properly addressed and as long as that continues so will their feelings of distress.

According to a new analysis by the nonprofit organization Oxfam Great Britain (Oxfam GB) the wealthiest 1% of people in the world have already exhausted their annual share of the global carbon budget.One s annual share of the carbon budget is the amount of carbon emissions per person that can be added into the atmosphere while remaining within the target for no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming compared to pre-industrial times. The richest 1% which includes 77 million people such as billionaires and millionaires surpassed their share of the carbon budget in just the first 10 days of 2025. By comparison someone in the poorest 50% of the global population would use up just their share of the annual global carbon budget in 1022 days.Not only are the ultra-wealthy using well beyond their share of the carbon budget but the ways that they are emitting are not providing economic benefits to society. The use of luxury private jets and super-yachts alongside polluting investments led the 50 richest billionaires to emit more carbon in 2.78 hours than it takes for an average person in Britain to emit in their entire lifetime.In order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius the wealthiest 1% of people globally need to reduce their emissions per capita by 97% by 2030. However Oxfam GB found that the 1% is currently on track to reduce emissions by only 5%.  Link in bio.

Earth s ozone layer   damaged in the 1970s and 1980s by ozone-depleting substances   is continuing to recover well according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) s newest Ozone and UV Bulletin report.United Nations Secretary-General Ant nio Guterres noted that the planet s ozone layer over Antarctica was on track for a full recovery under current policies though additional protection measures are crucial.The ozone layer is currently on course to get back to 1980 levels by approximately 2040 for most of the planet 2045 over the Arctic and 2066 over the Antarctic.According to Matt Tully chair of the Scientific Advisory Group on Ozone and Solar UV Radiation at WMO the UN organization s Global Atmosphere Watch Program continuously provides essential support for the scientific study and monitoring of the ozone layer through observations modeling analysis data stewardship and capacity-building.The report states that  total column ozone values in 2023 were within the range observed in previous years and in line with expectations owing to the beginning of the decline of ozone-depleting chlorine and bromine in the stratosphere. Though the changes to the ozone hole explained in the bulletin are positive the report found that atmospheric events can have big impacts on how the hole develops periodically. There are still some gaps in the understanding of these variables and WMO said scientists will continue detailed monitoring of the ozone layer to interpret any unforeseen changes.

The impacts of climate change on marine life from rising sea surface temperatures to ocean acidification have long been studied but new research is shedding light on the extent of these effects both currently and in the future  Scientists developed a method that fully considers the consequences of warming oceans and acidification on fish and invertebrate animals without canceling out certain other impacts such as when one species begins eating more and another eats less.Previously scientists determined three main ways that climate change can affect marine life including reduced chances of survival increased metabolism and weakened skeletons of invertebrates. By using the new method to evaluate the effects of climate change on marine life researchers found negative impacts on behavior physiology reproduction and physical development for fish and invertebrates.The researchers also estimated how acidification which happens as increasing amounts of carbon dioxide in the air dissolve into the ocean could continue to impact marine life in the future both with and without intervention.Even in a lower carbon emissions scenario the researchers determined that acidification will impact about 50% of biological processes in invertebrates and 30% of biological processes in fish still higher than previous estimates.

A first-of-its-kind study that analyzed hundreds of conservation actions around the world has confirmed that efforts toward preserving wildlife are resulting in measurable achievements  The international study published in the journal Science sought to assess whether conservation efforts were having any positive impacts on biodiversity. Researchers analyzed 186 studies including 665 trials and measured changes to biodiversity.Overall the researchers found that about two-thirds of the studied conservation actions at minimum slowed biodiversity declines or led to improved biodiversity. According to the study some actions were particularly impactful on biodiversity. Some of the most effective efforts include controlling invasive species reducing habitat loss restoring wildlife habitats establishing protected areas and managing ecosystems in sustainable ways.The study highlighted multiple efforts that resulted in wins for biodiversity.

A new study on plastic pollution in 84 countries has linked half of branded plastic pollution to only 56 firms with about 24% of the branded plastic waste analyzed connected to only five companies including The Coca-Cola Company PepsiCo Nestl  Danone and Altria  A team of researchers analyzed plastic pollution data from the Break Free From Plastic Brand Audit. The data spanned a total of 1576 brand audit events over five years from 2018 to 2022. The analysis revealed about 52% of the 1873634 plastic items in the study were unbranded which could be because sunlight water or other environmental factors caused fading on labels.Of the remaining plastic items that did have visible branding the study revealed the highest amount could be linked to one firm The Coca-Cola Company with 11% of the plastic waste items. The other brands linked to the highest number of analyzed plastic pieces include PepsiCo (5%) Nestl  (3%) Danone (3%) and Altria (2%). In total these five brands made up about 24% of the branded plastic waste items.In total 56 companies were responsible for over 50% of the branded plastic items while all of the branded plastic items were linked to 19586 companies.Much of the plastic waste could be traced back to companies that produce food beverage or tobacco products.

Wizz Air a budget airline based in Hungary has placed an order for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from human waste  The SAF is developed by a Bristol UK-based startup Firefly which has come up with a way to turn treated sewage into fuel. Wizz Air recently placed an order for up to 525000 metric tons of SAF for over the next 15 years from Firefly as a way of investing in the ideaAccording to the International Energy Agency the aviation industry is responsible for about 2% of global carbon emissions but advancements such as SAF can reduce the impact of air travel. However as The Guardian reported developing SAF can be cost- and resource-restrictive. It can be more expensive to develop than conventional aviation fuel and many SAFs rely on materials with limited stocks such as spent cooking oil or other food waste.Firefly s fuel is still undergoing regulatory testing but the company has plans to construct a factory for its operations in Harwich in Essex EnglandIn addition to helping the airline meet its goal of powering 10% of flights with SAF by 2030 the order for Firefly s SAF could also help Wizz Air meet the EU s regulations which will require 20% SAF for flights starting in the EU by 2030 and 70% SAF by 2050.

Bumblebees are essential pollinators but many species are in a downward spiral that is sometimes a mystery to scientists  In a new study researchers have found that the increasing temperatures of the human-caused climate crisis may be interfering with climate control in bumblebee nests threatening future generations.There are more than 250 species of bumblebee on Earth inhabiting a variety of environments. Many are in decline due to climate change but the specific cause has been difficult to pinpoint.After a review of 180 years of literature a team of researchers discovered that bumblebees seemed to survive at temperatures as high as 36 degrees Celsius while 30 to 32 degrees was the optimal range for development though that window could differ between biogeographical conditions and species.The right temperature means minimal metabolic expenditure while warmth in excess of that window can lead to dangerous heat stress. This means adaptation to higher temperatures could prove hard for bumblebees.The researchers said that while bumblebees have a number of behavioral adaptations for thermoregulation they may not be adequate to adapt to climate change.Honeybee studies have shown that hotter nest temperatures sap the strength of queen bees and weaken their ability to reproduce leading to smaller worker bees and less optimum conditions. If heat affects bumblebees in a similar way global heating could be a direct cause of their decline.

Brazil is facing its worst drought on record fueled by widespread deforestation and wildfire destruction in the Amazon and surrounding regions.The destruction hinders the area s natural water cycle especially its crucial  flying river  phenomenon. As the trees in the Eastern Amazon and Cerrado regions absorb rainfall brought about by moisture coming from the Atlantic they later release water vapor into the air through transpiration which then brings rainfall to much of Brazil and other parts of South America. But the trees the process requires are being destroyed leading to rivers drying up and areas that were once green now resembling deserts.As the Amazon s northeast is being destroyed not only is it disrupting the water cycle and leading to further droughts elsewhere but it s also releasing an enormous amount of carbon into the atmosphere.The Cerrado region in the country s southeast which is also a crucial part of the water cycle is in the midst of its worst drought in at least 700 years and more than 59% of the country is under stress from drought. In S o Paolo Brazil s most populated city with more than 21 million residents wildfires have reduced air quality to the second lowest in the world.  Link in bio.

A new study on global surface water and groundwater has found levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances also known as PFAS or  forever chemicals  to exceed limits considered safe  As reported by CNN the study found that limits of PFAS in some groundwater samples collected globally exceeded proposed limits by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Health Canada s set standards.Researchers collected over 45000 pieces of data from around the world spanning over 20 years to measure PFAS in source water.The team found high PFAS levels in source water in Australia particularly in areas that had been used for military purposes or fire training. PFAS are common in firefighting foams. But even 31% of samples from areas without known contamination sources had PFAS levels that exceeded proposed U.S. EPA limits for PFAS in drinking water. About 69% of samples from areas with unknown contamination sources exceeded the standards set by Health Canada.The authors did note however that these higher concentrations of PFAS were detected in source water such as surface water and groundwater but not in drinking water to which the safe limits apply.The authors warned that these findings were likely lower than the actual number of PFAS in source water as they monitored for a limited number of PFAS that some governments regulate. Further PFAS in consumer products could also be higher than previous estimates providing more contamination sources.  Link in bio.

Plastic   once seen as a marvel of modern science with uses from packaging to textiles   is now a scourge polluting our waterways exposing us to PFAS  forever chemicals  and making its way into our bloodstreams in the form of microplastics  Plastic production doubled worldwide in the 20 years prior to 2019 according to a team of researchers writing in The Conversation. Up to 20 percent of the planet s oil production could be taken up by plastic manufacturing and processing by 2040 using 15 percent of the yearly carbon emissions budget.The researchers looked at five years of litter audit data   global surveys of environmental waste   to get an idea of types of plastic waste and their volumes. The data included more than 1500 audits from 84 countries. The audits found that 48 percent of litter was brand-name while the remainder was unbranded.To figure out production levels the team looked at data reported by major plastics companies to a circular economy organization then compared it with branded plastic pollution data.They found that 13 companies each added one percent or higher to the overall branded plastic problem. The companies all produced beverage food or tobacco products that were mostly packaged using single-use plastic.Roughly 36 percent of plastic pollution worldwide comes from single-use plastics.

Britain has introduced new legislation in an attempt to crack down on water companies that pollute its lakes rivers and seas in what the government says is  the most significant increase in enforcement powers in a decade. The Water (Special Measures) Bill will give new powers to regulators to take faster and more stringent action to prevent water companies from harming the environment and  failing their customers  a press release from the Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) said.In addition to prison time the new law will ban bonuses to water bosses who fail to meet strict environmental protection standards while at the same time safeguarding the companies  finances and their customers.The bill includes severe automatic fines for a variety of offenses and allows regulators to swiftly issue penalties without having to conduct lengthy investigations DEFRA said in the press release. Independent monitoring of sewage outlets will also be introduced and water companies will be required to publish data for emergency overflows in real time along with a requirement that discharges be reported an hour or less after the initial spill.Water companies will also be responsible for the cost of enforcement actions taken because of their failings.

In an open letter seven United States senators are asking the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to do what dozens of countries have already done and ban the toxic weedkiller paraquat which has been associated with Parkinson s disease and other serious health risks.The October 31 letter addressed to EPA Administrator Michael Regan followed similar correspondence sent to the EPA by 47 Members of Congress earlier in the month also calling for a ban on the controversial herbicide.In their letter the lawmakers said some studies had found paraquat use to be associated with a 64 percent higher likelihood of developing Parkinson s thyroid cancer non-Hodgkin s Lymphoma and other thyroid problems. According to the EPA there is not a  clear link  between exposure to paraquat and Parkinson s.However the EPA said it would review additional studies and issue a final report on the matter by mid-January of next year.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has reported 161 sightings of whales last month representing seven different whale species. The sightings took place off the northeastern U.S. Coasts near Martha s Vineyard as well as southeast of Nantucket and according to NOAA the sightings included an unusually high number of whale species particularly endangered whales.The sightings don t necessarily mean there were 161 individual whales since some may have been counted multiple times but the recorded whale sightings were still a positive sign especially considering the high numbers of endangered species observed.The researchers observed 93 sei whales which are considered endangered under the Endangered Species Act. As stated on the NOAA website sei whales experienced major declines in the 19th and 20th centuries when around 300000 of these whales were hunted.In addition to the sei whales researchers noted three sightings of the North Atlantic right whale another endangered species humpback whales fin whales minke whales sperm whales and the rare sightings of two orcas which are not as common in this area.These sightings follow the rare observations of a gray whale off the northeastern U.S. in March by the New England Aquarium. New England Aquarium researchers observed a gray whale a species that has been considered extinct in the Atlantic Ocean for more than two centuries off the New England coast in an aerial survey. The rare gray whale sighting may be attributed to the species  adaptation to climate change scientists said.  Link in bio.  Paige Bennett.Humpback whales off the New England coast on May 25 2024.

In a settlement agreement between the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) Marathon Oil must pay a record penalty of $64.5 million and invest roughly $177 million in pollution reducing measures for allegedly violating the Clean Air Act. This is the largest penalty for Clean Air Act violations at stationary sources including power plants factories and refineries the EPA said.In their complaint the EPA and DOJ alleged violations of the Clean Air Act by Marathon at almost 90 of its facilities including those in western North Dakota s Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. The agencies said the violations produced thousands of tons of unlawful pollution.Specifically the facilities run by Marathon released illegal amounts of carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which the agencies said are associated with respiratory illnesses.The settlement agreement will lower VOCs by about 110000 tons as well as methane emissions that are the equivalent of two million-plus tons of carbon dioxide.

A new report from World Weather Attribution the Red Cross Crescent Climate Centre and Climate Central has found that the planet experienced 26 more days of  excess  extreme heat on average in the past year which most likely would not have happened without climate change  The report provides an overwhelming amount scientific evidence that extreme heat is a deadly manifestation of the climate crisis. It wreaks havoc on human health critical infrastructure the economy agriculture and the environment thereby eroding gains in human development and decreasing wellbeing especially for poor and marginalized communities in the global South.The ongoing Asia heat wave has been bringing excessive temperatures to Bangladesh Malaysia the Philippines Myanmar and Nepal causing many deaths and heat-related health issues. In Bangladesh the extreme heat has affected more than 120 million people and Myanmar experienced its hottest temperature ever recorded of 118.8 degrees Fahrenheit on April 28.In the study the researchers looked at the top 10 percent of temperatures for each country studied during the period 1991 to 2020. They then examined the 12 months from May 15 2023 to May 15 of this year in order to find out the number of days temperatures were within or above the previous range.Using peer-reviewed methods the scientists then looked at how climate change had influenced each of the excessively hot days.Their conclusion was that over the past year  human-caused climate change added an average of 26 days of extreme heat (on average across all places in the world) than there would have been without a warmed planet.The report also said that in the 12 months of the study period approximately 80 percent of the world s population   about 6.3 billion people   experienced a minimum of 31 days of extreme heat.

For whales that dive deeper into the oceans for food they face a growing threat: plastic pollution. That s because the sounds that plastics make can be very similar to the sounds that prey make leading to confusion for whales that rely on echolocation to source food.More and more research is uncovering plastic waste in the stomachs of deep-diving whales so. a team of researchers set out to find out why whales were mistaking plastic for food if they couldn t see the plastics which are often visually mistaken for food by marine life. The researchers collected trash like plastic bags plastic bottles bottles and balloons from a marine environment as well as pieces of dead squids that had been collected from the stomach of a dead sperm whale then tested the samples in a sonar transponder. The transponder and samples were placed underwater to mimic the whales  feeding environments and the researchers tested the acoustics at different frequencies since different whales may use varying frequencies when hunting.According to the study authors all of the plastic waste tested had similar if not stronger acoustic target strengths when compared with the samples of prey meaning it is likely that deep-diving whales are mistaking plastics for food by confusing the acoustic signals.

Renewable energy projects are rapidly expanding in China so much so that the country has double the amount of renewable capacity under construction compared to all other countries combined a new analysis from the non-governmental organization Global Energy Monitor.According to the analysis China currently has 180 gigawatts of utility-scale solar power and 159 gigawatts of wind power under construction. By comparison the U.S. has 40 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity currently under construction followed by Brazil with 13 gigawatts the UK with 10 gigawatts and Spain with 9 gigawatts.In total the amount of utility-scale solar and wind capacity under construction in China make up nearly two-thirds of the solar and wind capacity under construction worldwide.The report follows the China Electricity Council (CEC) s predictions from early 2024 that solar and wind capacity would outpace coal in China this year. According to the CEC report solar and wind capacity in China could make up about 40% of installed energy capacity in the country by the end of 2024 while coal could make up around 37%.  Link in bio.

At United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) headquarters in Washington Democratic Senator Edward J. Markey U.S. Representative for Arizona Yassamin Ansari and New York Representative Paul Tonko requested a meeting with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to discuss why funding for environmental programs was being  unconstitutionally cut off  a press release from the Office of Ed Markey said.The Trump administration has disregarded multiple court orders requiring that the funds be restarted.The three Democratic members of Congress had also planned  to demand that the funding that has already been authorized and appropriated by Congress be rightfully unfrozen  the press release said.In the lobby of the EPA the legislators faced a cold reception. The three legislators were escorted outside and stood in the building s entryway. A security officer told them they were waiting for a representative to come and speak with them.Following the attempted meeting other members of Congress as well as advocates and leaders of several unions and environmental groups including Green New Deal Network Hip Hop Caucus WE ACT for Environmental Justice Climate Action Campaign Union of Concerned Scientists National Council of Churches and Natural Resources Defense Council joined the lawmakers outside EPA headquarters for a press conference.They accused the newly appointed leaders of the EPA of defying court orders issued by the federal government to enforce legally mandated environmental protections.

Studies have recently detected microplastics in human lungs and blood and previous research shows humans ingest and inhale many microplastics even at home. In 2020 scientists uncovered microplastics in human organs for the first time. Now researchers are making sense of how microplastics that are ingested can make their way from the gut to other organs.Researchers studied mice that were exposed to and ingested microplastics over a four-week period and found those microplastics moved to organ tissues of the brain liver and kidney. The team also noted metabolic differences in the colon liver and brain after the microplastic exposure.Scientists estimate that humans consume about 5 grams of microplastics per week or about enough to fill a soup spoon. Estimates suggest humans consume about 21 grams of microplastics per month and 250 grams per year. Over a lifetime of about 79 years humans may consume 20 kilograms of microplastics.The scientists plan to further their research by examining whether different diets such as a high-fat diet compared to a high-fiber diet can impact microplastic exposure and ingestion  Link in bio.

Thousands of firefighters in California are battling the Park Fire in northern California after it doubled in size within 24 hours. The massive wildfire is the sixth-largest in the state s history having burned 370000 acres since it started. It had also destroyed more than 100 structures and threatened thousands more.The fire was 12 percent contained but evacuation orders or warnings remained for Butte Plumas Tehama and Shasta counties. Included in the evacuations was the town of Paradise devastated by the Camp Fire in 2018 which killed 84 people and was the deadliest in California history.According to the National Interagency Fire Center the Park Fire is one of dozens of wildfires that have burned in excess of two million acres across the country. Experts have said the Park Fire could keep spreading and Daniel Swain a University of California Los Angeles climate scientist said the enormous fire could burn for weeks or even months.

Photos of wildlife on social media have the power to boost conservation by depicting predators not only as beautiful but as similar to domestic pets.A new study has found that through their millions of followers Instagram and Facebook can steer public engagement and awareness toward support for predators like wildcats who are sometimes shot and poisoned by farmers.The research was based on the caracal wildcat   a native of Africa with prominent tufted ears   whose similarity to house cats has brought thousands of followers to internet streams about conserving the elegant felines a press release from Taylor & Francis said.The researchers point out that  charismatic  smaller mammals like the caracal can be  flagship species  for getting the word out about the purposes of scientific research in areas that are rapidly urbanizing.The findings suggest the graceful carnivore s online appeal is connected with viral images memes and videos of cats.

The Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS) has released video footage showing that the southern portion of the Great Barrier Reef is suffering from deep-sea coral bleaching. The footage shows that the bleaching extends at least as far down as 59.1 feet   the deepest reported during this mass bleaching event a press release from AMCS said. Some of the corals have begun to die in the face of record marine heat waves.Last week aerial survey data showed that 75 percent of the reef had experienced bleaching during the current bleaching event with much of it classed as  high to extreme bleaching. During climate change-driven marine heat waves extended periods of warmer ocean temperatures cause corals to become stressed which leads them to expel the algae that live in a symbiotic relationship with them. These algae not only give corals their colorful appearance but they are also their main source of energy so long periods without them can lead to starvation.Some southern reef areas have seen elevated water temperatures lasting for a record 14.57 weeks smashing the previous 11.8-week record set in April of 2020 according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data.The Great Barrier Reef s plight is directly related to human-caused climate change and no time must be lost in addressing and mitigating the source of the crisis  Link in bio.  cristenhemingwayjaynes.New video footage released on April 11 2024 shows that bleached corals on the southern part of the Great Barrier Reef extend to greater depths than has been reported during the current mass bleaching event.

The global average temperature for the period June 2023 to May 2024   12 consecutive months   was 1.63 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average making it the hottest on record according to new data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). It was also the longest stretch above the 1.5-degree threshold of the Paris Agreement.In May the average ocean surface temperature was 69.6 degrees Fahrenheit the warmest ever recorded for the month. It was the fourteenth record-setting month in a row for sea surface temperatures. The findings do not necessarily mean the Paris Agreement goal of global heating not exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius above the average for pre-industrial times has been breached as this target is measured by averages over decades rather than single years. However the trend does mean more extreme heat and climate-fueled weather events as well as the risk of disastrous tipping points.The data suggest this year could be hotter than 2023 which was the hottest on record.

#Finland is charting the leaderboards on the race to #cleanenergy.  Helsinki-owned energy group Helen took a big step towards a cleaner #Earth by shutting down their last coal-powered energy plant on April 1  . Power Magazine reports that #coal power now makes LESS than 1% of Finland s total energy. It s being replaced with #wind #hydropower #nuclear and #solar power which is actually saving money for its residents. Coal generated power is planned to be entirely banned   in Finland by 2029 which will bring Helen s #emission levels in 2030 to a measly 5% of what they were in 1990. Olli Sirkka CEO of Helen said this:  Our success is an excellent indication that at best the clean transition cost efficiency and Finland s security of supply can go hand in hand.

Deep in Canada s remote Brevoort Island in the Nunavut territory a radar technician was killed last week in a rare polar bear attack. Days earlier a polar bear was spotted in Rankin Inlet a remote but fairly populated Inuit settlement in the same territory. Experts warn that similar encounters with polar bears will likely become more common as climate change destroys their habitats and makes it more difficult to find food.According to a 2017 study published in the Wildlife Society Bulletin polar bears are more likely to attack humans when they re  nutritionally stressed  and are in  below-average body condition. Unlike other species polar bears can see humans as a potential food source making them extremely dangerous. In case of an encounter it s recommended to carry deterrents such as an air horn or bear spray and playing dead is not effective. Instead it s recommended to back away slowly and prepare to stand your ground by making loud noises and prepare for a potential fight aiming for the nose and head.As climate change worsens polar bear populations will decline as they need sea ice for habitation and for capturing seals according to a 2020 research article published in the journal Nature Climate Change.

Japan has its sights set on renewable energy producing 40 to 50 percent of its electricity by 2040 with another 20 percent coming from nuclear power according to a new draft of its basic energy policy.Japan is the second-largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) importer in the world as well as a big consumer of oil from the Middle East so its energy plans are of interest to gas oil and coal producers. The country s use of thermal power   particularly from coal-fired power plants   is on course to fall to 30 to 40 percent by 2040. Last year thermal energy made up 68.6 percent of the energy mix.Tokyo said nuclear power will play a major role in helping the country meet the growing energy demand from microchip factories and artificial intelligence. Japan s government had previously set a goal of becoming carbon-neutral by mid-century as well as reducing emissions by nearly 50 percent from 2013 levels by 2030.The new plans expect renewables like wind and solar to make up 40 to 50 percent of power generation by 2040. That s up from 23 percent last year and an earlier target of 38 percent by 2030.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has recently found that about half of all mangrove ecosystems in the world are at risk of collapsing meaning they are considered vulnerable endangered or critically endangered by the organization s Red List of Ecosystem standards  The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems measures the health and risks of specific ecosystems but this is the first time the standards have been used to assess an ecosystem at a global scale.IUCN reported that mangrove ecosystems face an increasing number of threats particularly from the effects of climate change. Frequent and severe weather events threaten the mangroves but they are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise.Mangrove ecosystems which require tropical humid environments are expanding into temperate areas because of climate change. According to IUCN agricultural use of freshwater has also limited the amount of freshwater that can reach coastal areas where mangroves typically thrive limiting the mangroves  ability to survive in their natural habitats.In a business-as-usual scenario about 25% of the global area covered by mangroves currently could be submerged over the next 50 years and about 33% of global mangrove ecosystems will be severely impacted.At the current rate the predicted mangrove losses would lead to a loss of 1.8 billion metric tons of stored carbon emissions equating to a cost to society of about $336 billion. Losing these mangrove ecosystems could also expose 2.1 million people to coastal flooding.  Link in bio.

According to the European Union s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) 2024 is highly likely to be the warmest year on record and to breach the 1.5 degree Celsius limit outlined in the Paris Agreement.The Paris Agreement s 1.5 degree Celsius target refers to limiting global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius higher than the global average temperature in pre-industrial times. This target was established by scientists to limit catastrophic impacts of climate change.Many countries have set climate targets including net-zero emissions goals to reduce emissions by 2050 as outlined by the Paris Agreement. But scientists now warn we are on track to breach the 1.5 degree Celsius limit for 2024 the first time this has happened for a calendar year. However Earth has already experienced a global average temperature of 1.5 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial times for 12 consecutive months. From February 2023 through Jan 2024 the temperature was 1.52 degrees Celsius higher than the global average temperature from 1850 to 1900.Now 2024 could be the first calendar year meaning from January 1 to December 31 to surpass 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming compared to pre-industrial global temperatures and it s set to be the hottest on record based on data from January through October of this year.

A major win for marine species!At the urging of Sierra Club Friends of the Earth and other green groups a United States federal judge has thrown out a National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) assessment governing how threatened and endangered marine species like whales and sea turtles ought to be protected from oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.The Maryland district court struck down the assessment   known under the Endangered Species Act as a  biological opinion    which was required to ensure that endangered and threatened species would not be jeopardized by exploration and drilling for fossil fuels in the Gulf.In 2020 NMFS filed the biological opinion and Earthjustice filed a lawsuit challenging. Plaintiffs argued the opinion failed to adequately evaluate the possibility of future Gulf of Mexico oil spills without requiring sufficient protections for imperiled sea turtles whales and other threatened and endangered marine species from offshore drilling operationsThe court s ruling affirms that the government cannot continue to turn a blind eye to the widespread persistent harms that offshore oil and gas development inflicts on wildlife and this decision means the Fisheries Service must comply with the law to put in place meaningful safeguards for the Gulf s rarest marine species.The court found multiple violations of the law in the biological opinion including an erroneous assumption that a disastrous soil spill such as the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon would not happen even though a NMFS analysis found that such a spill was to be expected. It also assumed wildlife populations in the Gulf were not affected by the spill despite evidence to the contrary.

In 2019 a group of major companies from around the world agreed to form the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW) an alliance that set out to reduce the amount of plastic flowing into the environment by around 15 million metric tons by the end of 2023. But according to a new report by Unearthed a Greenpeace investigative journalism team the initiative members have actually produced more than 1000 times the amount of plastic than they ve cleaned up in the 2019 to 2023 timeframe.The Unearthed team examined data provided by Wood Mackenzie a consultancy firm and found that five companies that are major players in the alliance including Shell ExxonMobil TotalEnergies ChevronPhillips and Dow were producing more plastic in just two days than the total amount of plastic the alliance has cleaned up since 2019. These companies produced 132 million metric tons of polyethylene and polypropylene alone in the 2019-2023 timeframe not including other types of plastics or the plastic produced by other member companies in the alliance.

The Key Largo tree cactus (Pilosocereus millspaughii) has become the first Florida species to become locally extinct due to the climate crisis according to researchers from the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden and the Florida Museum of Natural History.The Key Largo tree cactus population in the United States was made up of just one stand found in the Florida Keys which had been monitored on and off since being discovered in 1992. A once-thriving population of approximately 150 stems had by 2021 been reduced to six unhealthy fragments.Saltwater inundation from rising sea levels soil depletion due to high tides and hurricanes and mammal populations eating the plants had been putting pressure on the remaining cacti.The Key tree cactus had been succumbing to environmental pressures for a long time and was federally listed as endangered in 1984. From 1994 to 2007 its abundance decreased by 84 percent.When it was clear the Key Largo tree cactus population in Florida would not survive the researchers replanted its remaining green material in greenhouses or controlled outdoor settings but there are no known naturally growing plants remaining in the U.S.  Link in bio.  cristenhemingwayjaynes.The Key Largo tree cactus was initially found growing in the U.S. in 1992 at a single site.

Greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union fell by eight percent last year   to 37 percent below 1990 levels   according to a new report Trends and projections in Europe 2024 by the European Environment Agency (EEA).The massive reduction in pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels in 2023 was aided by the ramping up of renewables like solar and wind as well as the shutting down of coal-fired power plants.The European Commission called the reduction  very encouraging  saying it  reinforced confidence  in the bloc s ability to meet its goal of slashing emissions by 55 percent by 2030.The EEA report found that current EU policies are predicted to lower emissions by 43 percent below 1990 levels by the end of the decade. Additional measures that have yet to be implemented would bring the total reduction to 49 percent   leaving a six percentage point gap.

The enormous wildfires that ravaged Los Angeles in January were both more likely to form and more devastating due to climate change a rapid study from the World Weather Attribution has found.The scorching and dry conditions that led to the fires were made about 35% more likely due to human-caused climate change the researchers concluded. Combined with low rainfall   the conditions for which were found the be 2.4 times more likely due to climate change   and dry vegetation to fuel the fires the risk of fire compounded.The researchers used combined weather data with computer models to analyze how how much of a factor climate change played in the blazes comparing the pre-industrial climate to a more modern climate at about 1.3 C above that baseline.They also used the Fire Weather Index which  considers the hot dry and windy conditions that drive wildfires  and further analyzed the total rainfall from October to December which normally marks the tail-end of the fire season and used the drought code to determine how the duration of the fire season is changing in the region.They found that the conditions that fueled the fires are expected to happen about once every 17 years which is an increase of 35% compared to a pre-industrial climate. The Fire Weather Index was also found to be 6% more intense compared to an environment without climate change which has increased somewhat exponentially in recent years.The fires have destroyed an estimated 16000 structures and killed at least 28 people with thousands being dropped from their home insurance mere months before the fires hit.

** Update: The Park Service is now authorized to reinstate all 1000 probationary park staff who were terminated on 2/14. They were originally authorized to reinstate approximately 400 employees...   Speaking up works. Resistance works. Still the turmoil of firing and silencing puts our National Parks and those who steward them in peril. We must stay engaged and vigilant. ...Our National Parks are under threat! In 2024 visits to U.S. National Parks hit an all-time high with nearly 332 million visits (breaking the previous record set in 2016)...buuuuuut you probably haven t heard about it   An internal memo leaked by a group known as Resistance Rangers revealed that Park  staff were told not to promote the good news. There was just one quiet update on a government website. Coming shortly after the recent firing of over 1000 National Park staff many believe this silencing is meant to downplay the importance and popularity of National Parks. These moves could jeopardize over 30 different sites including visitor centers and emergency response stations.We need nature and nature needs us.

A week after it first formed in the warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean Hurricane Beryl crashed into Texas with heavy rains and strong winds on Monday killing at least two people.The Category 1 storm knocked out power for more than 2.5 million customers and led to more than 1000 flight cancellations. Lieutenant Governor of Texas Dan Patrick said crews would not be able to restore power until winds from the powerful storm died down.Hurricane Beryl made landfall on the Texas coast near Matagorda 95.8 miles south-southwest of Houston with 80-mile-an-hour maximum sustained winds. At least two Harris County residents were killed when the storm caused trees to fall on their homes including a 74-year-old woman reported NBC News and The New York Times. Eleven or more people have now been killed by Beryl in St. Vincent Grenada the Grenadines Venezuela Jamaica and Texas.After weakening to a tropical storm once it left the Caribbean and the Yucat n Peninsula in Mexico Beryl again strengthened to a hurricane fueled by the Gulf of Mexico s warm waters.Beryl s ability to rapidly and repeatedly gain strength is an indicator of what this hurricane season could bring.

Ecowatch videographer brynnerardin is an ocean lover and artist. Her first film  Dear Ocean  won second place at HUFF and we celebrate the blue planet and its heroes alongside her.Here s what Brynne had to say: It s not everyday you get to watch your own life story play out across the big screen. In April Giovana Roskosz Reis (giireis) and I headed to the to Houston Underwater Film Festival (HUFF) in Houston Texas to watch our short film  Dear Ocean  debut at the MATCH Theatre. This film was a beautiful collaboration piece with Giovana as director and director of photography and myself starring and writing the film. Our goal was to tell my unique life story as a love letter written to the ocean in the hopes that it would resonate with so many others who feel deeply connected to our blue planet. As environmental filmmakers our mission is to tell powerful stories of connection between human beings and the many species of our Earth in the hopes that they will influence more people to protect it. We are both so grateful that  Dear Ocean  is already doing just that. The most rewarding moment for me from HUFF was the overflow of love and comments from people both at the festival and online who shared with Giovana and myself that our film helped them feel seen and that my words helped them articulate a love for the ocean they had never quite known how to communicate to others before.   Dear Ocean  won second place at HUFF and has gone on to win  Best Student Film  at the 2024 Dana Point Film Festival in California and won the  Center of Environmental Filmmaking Award  at American University s Visions Awards as well as  Best Edited Film  by Women in Film and Video.

The signing of three new bills into law by California Gov. Gavin Newsom allows local communities to limit oil drilling while helping the state address pollution from  idle wells. The laws will help protect the environment and public health while empowering communities to set better protections around fossil fuel activities in their neighborhoods a press release from the governor s office said.The new laws give more authority to local governments to restrict oil and gas activities and shut down wells that aren t being used but haven t been properly closed and sealed.  Among other measures Newsom s administration has passed rules to phase out fossil-fuel powered cars trucks trains and lawnmowers. California has set a target of being carbon neutral by 2045.

It s no secret that modern humans have ravaged the planet. We have decimated ecosystems to make way for monocrop agriculture the raising of beef cattle and development. Ecosystems that had maintained a delicate balance for millions of years have been turned into ecological wastelands with cascading negative effects on biodiversity humanity and essential biogeochemical processes like Earth s water cycle.Rewilding is the reversing of negative impacts on natural environments through the restoration and conservation of ecosystems wilderness areas and their natural processes and it is essential for the survival of most life on our planet.This process involves reintroducing native species and allowing nature to heal and nurture itself. Doing so can not only restore biodiversity but it can protect endangered species prevent flooding and help mitigate climate change.Rewilding on both small and large scales provides and preserves natural habitats for plant and animal species.It can also mean added lands for wildlife corridors improve species diversity lower carbon dioxide emissions improve air quality and carbon sequestration help balance the water cycle protect against excessive runoff and flooding and make environments more climate-change resilient.

Conservation groups including the Center for Biological Diversity Oceana Greenpeace and the Natural Resources Defense Council filed two separate lawsuits against the Trump administration on Wednesday.Both complaints focus on the administration s moves to open more of the nation s waters to drilling for oil and gas.One group of plaintiffs is challenging a Trump executive order to repeal the protection of hundreds of millions of acres of United States coastal waters from oil and gas leasing executed by former President Joe Biden during his final days in office. The other group is requesting that the court reinstate a prior federal court ruling invalidating the first Trump administration s attempt to undo offshore drilling protections implemented during the Obama administration.The lawsuits will likely be the first of many filed by environmental groups against the current administration. In his first month in office Trump has frozen funds for climate-related spending programs while attempting to roll back many of Biden s environmental protections.

Ed Miliband the United Kingdom s secretary of energy and climate change recently announced the government s  clean power 2030  plan which includes measures giving ministers final approval of large onshore wind farms.The plan is part of an  ambitious  goal of reaching 95 percent green energy by the end of the decade. Miliband also wants the country s energy regulator to have the power to tackle energy projects waiting to be hooked up to the National Grid. The Labour government wants large onshore wind projects to be brought back into England s Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project system along with other energy infrastructure.Labour s plans would give the government the final word on the approval of wind projects bigger than 100 megawatts (MW) instead of putting local councils   which have frequently expressed opposition   in charge.The plan was welcomed by environmental groups as well as the energy industry.

Record wind-generated electricity across Northern Ireland and Scotland recently pushed Britain s power prices below zero.Wind output peaked at a record high 22.4 gigawatts (GW) breaking the previous high the national system operator said. The record output provided more than 68 percent of the country s power. The half-hourly price fell to 6.57 pounds per megawatt-hour according to data from European power exchange Epex Spot.The record was a major reversal from previous low wind output when electricity was mostly supplied by gas.However the enormous fluctuations in Europe s weather have demonstrated the challenge to governments in supplying power as the transition to renewable energy speeds up. When weather in the United Kingdom is cloudy or winds are calm gas will still be used to generate electricity.As a result the UK s Labour government has a goal of quadrupling offshore wind power doubling onshore wind and tripling solar by 2030 with an overall target of 95 percent green energy.

A new report by Earth Track has found that the world is spending a minimum of $2.6 trillion annually on subsidies that destroy the environment and fuel global heating.One of the biggest achievements of the 2022 COP15 Convention on Biodiversity was the passage of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) which has a target of protecting and restoring nature by 2030. Target 18 of the GBF included the first quantitative goal for the reduction of environmentally harmful subsidies (EHS) a news release from Earth Track said. The target committed to reducing EHS by $500 billion each year by the end of the decade.An initial review of the state of EHS in 2022 included looking at a variety of economic sectors that impact land-use changes and the extraction of resources since it is the combined effect of subsidies that drives nature and biodiversity loss.Earth Track found that governments are continuing to provide billions in subsidies tax breaks and other fundings that frustrate the goals of the GBF and the 2015 Paris Climate Accord reported The Guardian. The report uncovered channels of direct financial support being provided by nations for deforestation fossil fuel consumption and water pollution.The new EHS estimate by Earth Track is roughly $800 billion higher than in 2022   $500 billion after adjusting for inflation. The organization said the increase was due to improved data estimates for rising fossil fuel subsidies non-energy mining plastics production and inflation with fossil fuel subsidies being the biggest driver.

Less than half of injured or stunned birds survive collisions with windows new research has found which means as many as one billion birds may be killed each year from flying into buildings in the United States.The discovery was made by a team of ornithologists with the NYC Bird Alliance the Fordham University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the Max Planck Institute for Geoanthropology.The researchers analyzed the wildlife rehabilitation records of thousands of birds who had been involved in window collisions. Previous research had found that windows are extremely hazardous for birds as they are not able to see them other than by what is reflected off their surfaces which is often viewed as open spaces to fly into. When birds do collide with windows it often leads to death head injuries that can be fatal or a sometimes temporary stunning effect.The research team looked at data from 3100 cases of avian window collisions in eight states from 2016 to 2021 to come up with an estimate of how many birds are killed after surviving initial impact. They discovered that 60 percent of birds who were treated still died mostly from brain injuries. They noted that birds commonly  wake up  following impact and fly away seemingly uninjured.When the researchers considered these cases the total number of birds who died from colliding with windows in the U.S. each year rose to roughly one billion.Preventing birds from colliding with windows is as easy as placing stickers or tape to windows and turning off lights at night.

Sydney s Sea Life Aquarium witnessed a beautiful expression of emotion as Magic and the other gentoo penguins in his colony sang mourning the loss of his partner Sphen. Their same-sex love story during which they shared the duties of raising their adopted young made the couple famous around the world.Sphen who was almost 12 was thought to have died of natural causes the aquarium said.Renee Howell the aquarium s penguin keeper watched the blossoming of Sphen and Magic s love story saying they had an  immeasurable  impact on the world as a symbol of equality.The couple s courtship began with the collecting and presenting of pebbles as gentoos do when wooing each other.Sphen and Magic became known worldwide in 2018. During their relationship they adopted and reared two chicks Sphengic (Lara) born in 2018 and Clancy two years later.According to Howell same-sex partnerships among penguins are believed to be somewhat common. As with penguin couples of the opposite sex Sphen and Magic shared parenting responsibilities taking turns on the nest searching for food and caring for their eggs.To let Magic know what had happened to Sphen keepers took him to see his partner s body. When Magic saw Sphen he immediately started to sing joined shortly after by the rest of the 45-penguin colony  Link in bio.  cristenhemingwayjaynes.Penguin couple Sphen and Magic became foster parents to a baby chick born on Oct. 19 2018.

A drought in much of South America impacts more than 420000 children living in the Amazon basin according to new estimates from UNICEF.The record-breaking drought   ongoing since last year   has left rivers in the region at an all-time low a press release from UNICEF said.The lack of rain has affected river transportation and water supplies for Indigenous children and their communities in Colombia Brazil and Peru. Families use the rivers to access and transport water food fuel and medical supplies. The children also use them to travel to school.Food insecurity caused by the drought has increased malnutrition risk in the region s children while restricted access to drinking water could lead to an increase in infectious diseases. In the Brazilian Amazon more than 760 medical clinics and over 1700 schools have become inaccessible or were forced to close due to low river levels.In addition to essential health child protection and education services being drastically disrupted in the region fishing and agricultural livelihoods have also been interrupted putting lives at risk.

Temperatures in the North Pole on Sunday reached 20 degrees Celsius above the average set between 1991 and 2020 after reaching 18 degrees higher than the average on Saturday February 1st.With the rise the temperature in the North Pole surpassed the point of freezing or 0 degrees Celsius. One reading measured the temperature at 0.5 degrees Celsius and the EU Copernicus Climate Change Service measured temperatures above -1 degree Celsius as far up as the 87th parallel in the Arctic.According to data from the EU Copernicus Climate Change Service the Arctic has warmed by around 3.3 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times compared to about 1.3 degrees Celsius of warming globally.The rapidly increasing temperatures of the Arctic even in the winter have scientists concerned over ice melt rising sea levels and emissions. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center Arctic sea ice has been decreasing at a pace of 13% per decade since 1979.  Link in bio.

Beginning in late fall 2014 and lasting into 2016 an anomalous massive marine heatwave nicknamed  the Blob  developed off the western coast of the U.S. covering all of Alaska s coastwater and extending as far south as Southern California raising ocean temperatures by several degrees Celsius.The Blob had an extreme effect on Alaska in particular. According to a recently released study it resulted in the deaths of roughly four million common murres   one of Alaska s most prominent seabirds   representing a decline of more than half of the state s entire population.The study authors wrote that the heatwave had an enormous effect on key habitat-forming species like corals and kelps which triggered cascading bottom-up harm toward the top of the food chain.Common murres rely on fish as a food source but the fish they normally prey on were largely absent due to the cascading effects of the heatwave making the most likely cause of the die-off a mass-starvation event.Despite having plenty of time the murres  population has not begun to recover but the cause is unclear.

More than a third of animals on Earth are herbivores but since plants don t have a lot of calories it can be hard for grazers to eat enough to meet their energy needs. To add to the problem climate change is lowering the nutritional value of certain foods that these plant eaters rely on.Fossil fuel emissions produced by humans are causing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide to rise pushing up temperatures worldwide. This is causing plants to grow faster in ecosystems across the globe research biologist Ellen Welti with the Smithsonian Institution s Great Plains Science Program wrote in The Conversation.Welti said changes in plants  long-term nutritional value could be one underappreciated cause of falling animal populations however more research will be necessary to understand the role of nutrient dilution in the declines of individual species.

Intense wildfires are ravaging the Arctic Circle bringing smoke and high carbon emissions according to the European Union s Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)  The region had experienced 164 wildfires through June 24 most of which have been in the Sakha Republic of Russia.  According to data from the CAMS Global Fire Assimilation System June wildfire carbon emissions are already the third highest for the month since 2003.The accumulation of wildfire smoke impacts air quality at high latitudes. It also has the potential to cause aerosols in the smoke to deposit onto surfaces like snow and ice reducing their ability to reflect sunlight meaning they absorb more solar energy and are more prone to melting.According to the most recent report from Russian federal organization Avialesookhrana as of June 27 72 active wildfires were burning in the Sakha Republic covering an area of nearly 700000 acres.The region s wildfire activities come after a period of unusually high surface air temperatures in late May with local media reporting forecast temperatures seven to nine degrees Celsius above normal. Copernicus Climate Change Service data confirmed the predictions with warmer surface temperatures and drier soils in the first three quarters of June.As global heating leads to higher temperatures in the Arctic wildfires have shifted north and are burning through tundra and boreal forest which releases enormous stores of greenhouse gases from the carbon-rich soils.

Australia s Great Barrier Reef   the world s largest coral reef system   has been under critical pressure in recent years with warming sea surface temperatures leading to mass coral bleaching that threatens its unique biodiversity ecology and stunning beauty.Temperatures in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) have reached the hottest in more than 400 years new research has found presenting an  existential threat  to the UNESCO World Heritage Site.The researchers reconstructed 400 years of Coral Sea summer surface temperatures and found that recent extreme ocean heat has resulted in mass coral bleaching of the GBR.The research team led by Dr. Benjamin Henley   a professor and honorary fellow at University of Melbourne   used geochemical data from previously collected coral cores in the region for the temperature reconstructions. They also looked at sea surface temperature simulations with and without the effects of climate change using climate models and found that the rising temperatures were the result of the human-caused climate crisis.Five of the six warmest years on record coincide with the recent Coral Sea mass bleaching events. The sea experienced the highest temperatures in 400 years in 2017 2020 and 2024 with this year being the warmest by a wide margin. The next warmest three years were in 2004 2016 and 2022.

In a new report the nonprofit As You Sow has found that of 147 companies with recyclability targets only 22 are on track to meet their goals. In total the report reviewed 225 companies and their progress toward plastic-related goals with about half of companies receiving an  F  score.The 2024 Plastic Promises Scorecard has revealed a gap between the plastic waste reduction goals that companies set and the actual actions they are making toward meeting those goals. The report evaluated companies on a total score based on their ambitions and their actions toward goals related to six pillars: recyclability reduction recycled content recovery reusable and extended producer responsibility. Ambitions counted toward 30% of the total score while the actual actions companies were taking made up 70% of the final score.Plastic Promises Scorecard uses a first-of-its-kind scoring system to evaluate not just what companies say they will do to act on the plastics crisis but what they have actually accomplished. The findings showed that most of the companies in the report had targets to incorporate recycled content but the same companies weren t investing in recycling infrastructure to collect old packaging and recycle it. Only nine of the 225 companies had even set goals to create zero-waste packaging that could be reused or recycled indefinitely rather than becoming waste.The latest Plastic Promises Scorecard did show some hope though. It found that more companies were supportive of producer responsibility legislation and As You Sow shared in a press release that shareholders for multiple companies including Hershey and Amazon were supportive of more sustainable packaging initiatives.

According to a new proposal put forth by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) the Florida manatee a subspecies of the West Indian manatee will remain listed as a threatened species and will be submitted separately for protections from another subspecies the Antillean manatee. The Antillean manatee has been proposed to be listed as an endangered species.The proposal determined that although Florida manatees face threats from boat strikes algal blooms loss of their food source (seagrasses) and loss of warm-water refuge areas the subspecies still does not meet the criteria to relist Florida manatees as endangered. USFWS stated that it made its latest proposal to maintain the threatened status of Florida manatees while uplisting Antillian manatees as endangered based on the estimate that the Florida manatee s likelihood of extinction in the next 150 years was lower than 1%.However environmentalists have argued that the Florida manatee should be relisted as an endangered species.

More than 10000 survivors and loved ones of survivors of  climate-driven disasters  have signed an open letter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) urging an investigation into fossil fuel companies for  climate-related crimes. Of the signatories more than 1000 were survivors of these disasters and more than 9000 were loved ones. Public Citizen said they along with Chesapeake Climate Action Network delivered the letter to the DOJ.The letter comes at a time of increased public pressure against the fossil fuel industry and during which climate-related civil lawsuits have increased at an unprecedented pace and have been mostly successful.The letter also asserts that fossil fuel companies have known since the 1950s about the dangers posed by the use of fossil fuels and in the decades since waged a  disinformation campaign  to dispel the science and mislead the public.

More than 1220 volunteers have cleaned up nearly 9.9 tons of marine litter from beaches in East Africa s Seychelles islands in what researchers called an impressive example of citizen science  The cleanup took place on 52 beaches across 10 islands from June 2019 to July 2023.The volunteers picked up trash ranging from rubber and foam to plastics and metals. Of those 13525.4 pounds were non-plastic items and 6250.1 pounds were made of plastic like bottles food packaging and weathered ocean debris.Ocean currents bring waste to the islands  beaches where it becomes trapped by vegetation.In some places much of the trash was recorded as having been produced locally but as much as 75 percent was determined to have originated elsewhere.The researchers said the study shows some of the obstacles island communities face with waste management as well as how locals can help address the issue.

The Trump administration plans to reconsider an official finding by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from 2009 that greenhouse gases harm public health.The  endangerment finding  for greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act forms the foundation of the country s climate regulations.However during his his confirmation hearing EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin acknowledged the threats caused by sea level rise and climate change but has been viewed as backtracking on his promise to  respect the science and listen to the experts. The 2009 endangerment finding followed a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that the EPA had the authority to regulate greenhouse gases and is the basis for all pollution reduction rules.  Zeldin said the EPA would reconsider the finding over concerns that it had resulted in  an agenda that throttles our industries our mobility and our consumer choice while benefiting adversaries overseas. Since its creation in 1970 the EPA s main mission has been to protect public health and the environment.

Rising sea levels threaten to completely submerge Tuvalu in the coming decades. Facing an unprecedented crisis officials are not only trying to preserve a shrinking country but attempting to ensure the nation as well as its culture and traditions will still exist even if its land doesn t.By 2050. It s estimated that about half of the country will be underwater. By 2100 that number would be 95%. Tuvalu is extremely susceptible to rising seas due to its small size and low elevation which is just about two meters above sea level on average.Although it has just 10 square miles of land mass Tuvalu also controls about 290000 square miles of the Pacific. It s through this patch of ocean   Tuvalu s maritime boundaries   that officials are trying to maintain the country s existence even if the sea submerges each of its nine islands.

In 2024 the U.S. National Parks received a record-high visitor turnout even higher than the previous record set in 2016. But based on an internal memo shared by the group Resistance Rangers which is made up of current and former National Park Service (NPS) workers NPS staff have been told not to share external communications about the record number of visits.The information is publicly available on the NPS Visitation Statistics Dashboard which shared that there were 331.9 million visits to National Parks sites in 2024 up from the previous record of 330971689 set in 2016. This number also increased by 6.36 million visits or 2% compared to visits in 2023.Yet according to the internal memo shared by Resistance Rangers NPS workers were advised that there would be no external communications rollout. The internal memo noted that parks could share the visitor number info on their websites if  that is the park s standard process (e.g. parks that post monthly visitation reports) but should not issue a press release or other proactive communications including social media posts. As the parks reach record-high attendance both Resistance Rangers and NPCA have pointed out that NPS is under threat with recent mass firings and planned NPS office closings.  Link in bio.

Are you interested in finding a way to teach others about the climate crisis? We have the perfect resource for you! The climate crisis refers to the destabilization of the climate conditions that have allowed human communities and current ecosystems to survive and thrive on Earth. It is caused by a rise in global temperatures that scientists conclude is  unequivocally  driven by human activity   primarily the burning of fossil fuels and secondarily the destruction of forests and other natural carbon sinks. Since humans began using fossil fuels in earnest at the start of the industrial revolution global temperatures have risen to 1.1 degrees Celsius above the 1850 to 1900 average. Global heating has now reached a rate of increase of more than 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade. This warming has already led to the melting of Arctic sea ice the retreat of glaciers and more frequent and intense extreme weather events like heat waves foods and droughts. These events have already claimed lives driven species to extinction and forced more than 13 million people from their homes in Africa and Asia in 2019 alone. With every further warming increase the risks of additional harms become ever more severe.  Interest in learning more? Head on over to the link in our bio..

The United States Supreme Court has voted five to four to weaken rules that govern how much pollution is discharged into the country s water supply undermining the 1972 Clean Water Act.The case involved San Francisco suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) after the city was found to have violated the terms of a permit required for the discharge of wastewater pollution into the Pacific Ocean. San Francisco officials argued that the EPA s authority had been exceeded due to vague permit rules that made it impossible to tell when a line had been crossed.The justices ruled that generic prohibitions against violations of water quality standards cannot be imposed by the EPA. The decision could impact businesses as well as other cities like Boston New York and Washington DC that are adjacent to bodies of water.The case has split environmental groups that often agree with liberal cities like San Francisco as well as the EPA.

Not your problem? More like... Net your problem! The Florida Keys is a renowned fishing community   Healthy fisheries support over 1700 local jobs and bring in around $180.4 million to the local economy. They also use a loooooot of fishing gear. What happens to all the broken and used nets line traps and gear when it s lived out its useful life?   Unfortunately not much   Most fishing gear is made of plastic which doesn t biodegrade in the ocean. Instead  ghost gear      lost or abandoned fishing gear   continues to  fish  and engangle marine animals and corals long after it s been discarded into the ocean.This is where netyourproblem comes in!   This Seattle based company s mission is to create an economically viable way to recycle end-of-life fishing gear improve waste management and reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions related to virgin plastic production. They do this by engaging a variety of stakeholders and partners   like Florida Keys fishermen - to build a circular economy where plastic waste becomes a solution instead of pollution.

Major rivers in Russia and Kazakhstan have risen above their embankments causing more than 120000 people to have to flee their homes in the worst flooding in some areas in almost a century.Residents along the 1509-mile Ural River which flows through Russia and Kazakhstan were forced to evacuate by its fast-rising waters while Orenburg a Russian city of about 550000 was one of the hardest hit.Entire areas of Orenburg were submerged as snowmelt caused the Ural to swell to a level much higher than what was deemed safe by authorities.The flooding  might be the biggest disaster in terms of its scale and impact in more than 80 years  said President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. In Orenburg the local government said the flooding caused the evacuation of more than 7700 people from almost 13000 residential buildings.The city s water levels rose to approximately 33 feet the mayor said higher than the critical level of 30.5 feet.Springtime flooding is common in Russia but the scale of the event was rare.Flooding in the region looked to be far from over.

Did you know that that almost half of food waste globally   roughly 620 million metric tons   could be saved by food supply chains being fully refrigerated? Each year approximately a third of worldwide food production goes to waste a press release from UMichigan said. Meanwhile according to the United Nations  Food and Agriculture Organization roughly 800 million people go hungry.According to a recent study by fully refrigerating food supply chains   creating  cold chains    greenhouse gas emissions related to food waste would be reduced by 41 percent globally.Parts of Asia could see a food loss reduction of 45 percent as well as 54 percent lower associated emissions under optimized refrigeration conditions the study said. And food loss in Sub-Saharan Africa could be reduced by 47 percent while their emissions could drop by 66 percent in an optimized refrigeration scenario.The researchers of this study said the actual greenhouse gas emissions reductions would depend on cold-chain technology efficiency as well as the carbon intensity of electrical grids since emissions from refrigeration can be significant.The researchers also found that in many situations the development of less industrialized and more local  farm-to-table  supply chains could result in food savings comparable or even exceeding optimized cold chains. The study compared the benefits of  farm-to-table  food systems with those of technologically advanced and globalized food-supply chains.

Native species are struggling to keep pace with invasive species in range expansion which is important for adaptation and survival a new study has found  According to researchers species need to be able to shift at least 3.25 kilometers per year to keep up with climate change. However they found that native species are only moving at an average rate of around 1.74 kilometers per year.In general invasive species are spreading 100 times faster than native plants and animals and even some that seem more sedentary are moving at least three times faster than native species. To compare how human actions drove range expansion the researchers analyzed data for 249 native species 242 non-native species and 192 non-native species introduced through human actions.The study revealed that invasive species were moving at a rate of around 35 kilometers per year without human actions. But when factoring in the ways humans contribute to the spread of invasive species the shift can happen at a rate of around 1883 kilometers per year or around 1000 times faster than native plants and animals.

United States Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland recently announced that protections against oil and gas development   including mining claims   across 28 million acres of federal lands in Alaska will remain intact.Many of Alaska s Native Tribes Tribal entities and Native Corporations have said the lands are crucial for safeguarding important natural subsistence and cultural resources a press release from the Department of the Interior (DOI) said.The action by DOI was in response to the unlawful decision of the previous administration to remove longstanding protections    withdrawals    without conducting a sufficient analysis of potential impacts on subsistence and other essential resources appropriate consultation with Tribes and other legal requirements. The sweeping move would have allowed millions of acres to be opened to extractive development activities and taken away the federal subsistence priority for millions of acres.The decision had been put on hold so that these potential impacts could be given full consideration as well as to allow time for engagement with Alaska Native communities and the public.The announcement builds on the current administration s conservation actions for millions of acres of Alaska s lands and waters. These include protecting roughly 2.8 million acres in the Beaufort Sea so that new oil and gas leases are prohibited in the whole of the U.S. Arctic Ocean implementing maximum protections for 13 million-plus acres in Special Areas of the western Arctic and preventing irreversible harms to permafrost and Tribal subsistence.

Last year s record-breaking wildfires in Canada produced almost a decade s worth of greenhouse gas emissions from wildfires in one season.According a new study co-led by University of East Anglia (UEA) the United Kingdom s Met Office the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH) climate change made the unparalleled wildfires in Canada and portions of Amazonia a minimum of three times more likely and produced roughly 2.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide   approximately one-fourth of the total wildfire emissions worldwide.The report found that wildfire carbon emissions were 16 percent above average globally with a total of 9.48 billion tons of carbon dioxide. Emissions from Canadian boreal forest fires were more than nine times above the average for the last two decades contributing nearly a quarter of worldwide emissions.The Canadian wildfires caused more than 230000 people to be evacuated and claimed the lives of eight firefighters. The study s climate models suggested that extreme wildfires will become more intense and frequent by 2100 especially in high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Forecasts for the 2024-25 fire season indicated a continuation of above-average probability of fire weather s dry hot and windy conditions in portions of South and North America with favorable wildfire conditions for June and July in the Brazilian Pantanal British Columbia Alberta and California.

Landfills in the United States   one of the country s biggest sources of pollution   have been found to contain large amounts of toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)  forever chemicals. A recent study has found that PFAS likely make their way into the surrounding environment through gas emitted from landfills since treatment systems at the facilities are not equipped to destroy or manage the hazardous chemicals.PFAS are a group of synthetic chemical compounds used to make products that are water heat and stain resistant such as clothing cookware and firefighting foam. Termed  forever chemicals  because they persist in the environment without breaking down they have been found to build up in the bodies and bloodstreams of humans and other animals.PFAS have been associated with birth defects cancer liver and thyroid diseases and other serious health problems.While gas collection systems can capture much of the landfill emissions   in some instances running it through filters or burning it off in flares   PFAS are hard to destroy and are not effectively eliminated by flares. Instead incinerators and flares break down forever chemicals into smaller forms sending the waste into the air.Currently there is no accurate estimate of the levels of airborne PFAS pollution landfills create or a proven solution.

In a new analysis acclaimed climate scientist Professor James Hansen and colleagues said that scientists had greatly underestimated the rate of global heating and that the international target of two degrees Celsius is  dead. The analysis concluded that the combination of recent reductions in shipping pollution   which have the effect of blocking the sun   and increasing emissions from fossil fuels have been greater than previously thought. Independent experts said that though the results of the study are on the high end of the range of mainstream climate science they cannot be ruled out. If the estimates are correct more extreme weather will happen sooner with a bigger risk that the planet will surpass tipping points like the collapse of crucial Atlantic ocean currents.According to the new analysis without changes the planet will likely warm by about two degrees Celsius by 2045.

Over the last decade people living in the United States have become more aware that the climate crisis is harming their health according to a new survey conducted by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the George Mason University (GMU) Center for Climate Change Communication.The nationally representative survey was conducted in December of last year and paints a picture of Americans  perceptions of the health risks posed by various sources of energy and climate change.Global heating is the source of many health problems in the U.S. including injuries and deaths caused by extreme weather wildfires heat waves floods increased air pollution and a wider geographic range for infectious diseases.Among the report s key findings was that 39 percent of Americans believe global warming is harming the country s health  a great deal  or  a moderate amount  which is an increase of eight percent since 2014. In contrast just 16 percent believe their personal health is being impacted negatively by global heating to the same extent.Meanwhile 65 percent of Americans believe coal is harmful to people s health while 38 percent think the same about natural gas   nine points higher than in 2018.The survey s principal investigator Edward Maibach said the results were fundamentally irreconcilable with actions taken by the Trump administration.

Is this goodbye to polar bears in Hudson Bay Canada?Global heating is predicted to lower the period of sea ice extent on Canada s Hudson Bay shortening the hunting season for its roughly 1700 resident polar bears.According to a new study if global temperatures increase to more than 2.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels the length of most of Hudson Bay s ice-free period could be longer than the polar bears normally fast threatening their survival.May is normally an ice-covered month for Hudson Bay but according to NASA s National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) this year was the lowest sea ice extent for the month since satellite records began in 1979.Hudson Bay and the surrounding area is home to three of the 19 remaining polar bear populations in the world.Unlike the Arctic Hudson Bay completely thaws during the summer months leading polar bears to fast while they await the return of the ice which they need to hunt their main prey: seals.Since 1987 half the population of polar bears in Western Hudson Bay has disappeared. The research team looked at warming predictions from 20 climate models and found that this part of the bay would no longer be suitable habitat for the bears at approximately 2.2 degrees Celsius of planetary warming.

According to a new study global methane emissions are  rising rapidly    at the fastest pace in decades   with immediate action needed to help curtail a dangerous intensification of the climate crisis.The study outlines three  imperatives  for reducing methane emissions as well as a new tool to assist nations with optimizing cost-effective methods to reduce their methane emissions.The actions called for by the study s authors include reversing methane emissions growth aligning carbon dioxide and methane mitigation and optimizing policies and technologies for the abatement of methane at the global national and sector levels. A potent greenhouse gas methane is responsible for roughly half of global heating since preindustrial times. Methane emissions have gone up quickly since 2006 with record emissions in 2021 and 2022.According to the report emissions will keep rising through the 2020s if new measures are not taken to curb them.

Vattenfall a Swedish energy company and Superuse an international design studio based in Rotterdam have teamed up to repurpose an old decommissioned wind turbine into a tiny home.In a new project on display for Dutch Design Week Vattenfall set out to showcase circular solutions in the wind energy sector. It worked with Superuse to convert an old wind turbine that had been operating for 20 years in Austria.The house spans 4 meters wide 10 meters long and 3 meters tall and as part of its mission to achieve a fossil fuel-free future Vattenfall equipped this tiny home with eco-friendly components including solar panels a heat pump and a solar water heater. The project was designed by Superuse and developed by Blade-Made a spin-off of Superuse and Woodwave.The tiny home helped salvage the steel and other metals and concrete that could otherwise go to waste when a wind turbine is decommissioned. The house is also furnished with sustainably made and secondhand pieces.Companies like Vattenfall are continuing to consider methods of repurposing turbine parts to further extend the lifespan of these wind turbines and prevent them from going to landfills  Link in bio.

In a whale migration of epic proportions a humpback has been recorded making a journey of more than 8077 miles from Colombia to Tanzania.A team of marine ecologists says it s the longest individual whale migration ever recorded topping the old record of 6214 miles.While a whale will sometimes move from one group to a different one nearby to get all the way from Colombia to Tanzania the humpback would have had to pass through two Atlantic-based groups.The observation of the whale s extraordinary journey was enabled by modified facial recognition software that was designed to identify whales by the distinct shapes of their flukes.These  flukeprints  have saved marine scientists many hours of looking over photos in the hopes of uncovering a match based on distinctive markings such as scars notches and color patterns.

Have you ever noticed that meadows of long grass seem to be teeming with butterflies bumble bees beetles crickets and other insects? Meanwhile short-cropped bright green lawns appear devoid of critters in comparison  A six-year study of butterfly sightings in 600 gardens in the United Kingdom has confirmed that letting your lawn grow wild can significantly increase butterfly and moth numbers.The biggest benefits to garden rewilding were found in intensively farmed areas and urban spaces. Gardens with long grass in highly arable areas had as much as 93 percent more butterflies while urban landscapes saw an increase of 18 percent. The study looked specifically at gardens but the benefits of wild spaces and long grass for butterflies are likely applicable to other green spaces like parks small fruit and vegetable patches the grounds of schools and strips of grass and vegetation between sidewalks and roadways. These areas could become important wildlife refuges if allowed to flourish.

The government of Zimbabwe has ordered a cull of 200 elephants amid an ongoing drought and food shortages in the country. The order will be the first elephant cull since 1988.Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Authority (ZimParks) has been tasked with the cull. Fulton Mangwanya director general of ZimParks said that the culling will be prioritized in areas where there have been human-elephant conflicts.According to the ZimParks website Zimbabwe has the second largest population of elephants in the world. Namibia which neighbors Zimbabwe recently ordered a similar cull for over 700 animals including 83 elephants. The decision has brought criticism from both conservationists and those concerned about the cull s impact on tourism. Those in support of elephant culling argue it will not only feed people and reduce pressure on resources but will also control the increasing elephant population and its impact on the environment.As for alternatives to elephant culling World Wildlife Fund has listed several options including translocation conflict mitigation efforts and breeding regulations and contraceptives. The organization also supports the development of overpopulation guidelines and procedures by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).  Link in bio.

Scientists have found that Earth may soon pass another planetary boundary meaning it could be operating outside of the safe limits for seven of the nine defined planetary boundaries.The Planetary Health Check report prepared by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) is a new assessment that determines the state of the planetary boundaries. For its first edition the report found that Earth is near the boundary for ocean acidification.The planetary boundaries are a framework in which Earth has nine major areas that it can operate safely: climate change biosphere integrity land-system change freshwater use biogeochemical flows novel entities stratospheric ozone depletion atmospheric aerosol loading and ocean acidification.When the framework was introduced in 2009 scientists determined that Earth had passed three boundaries including climate change biosphere integrity and biogeochemical flows.By 2023 scientists determined Earth had crossed three additional boundaries including land-system change freshwater use/change and novel entities which includes plastics.But now ocean acidification is close to passing its boundary putting marine life at risk.

A new study led by Dartmouth College researchers has found that a  worst-case  projection for sea level rise from the melting of polar ice sheets is highly unlikely though the accelerating ice loss in Antarctica and Greenland is still alarming.The study challenges a prediction in a United Nations  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report that evaluates climate research and projects long- and near-term climate crisis impacts.The team used three high-resolution models to test the MICI (marine ice cliff instability) with an ice collapse rate that  more accurately  captured the complicated dynamics of ice sheets. They simulated Antarctica s Thwaites Glacier   called the  Doomsday Glacier  for its accelerating rate of melt and corresponding potential to raise sea levels   retreating and found that even Thwaites was not likely to experience rapid collapse this century.Morlinghem said the study s findings suggested that the physics in the IPCC report were inaccurate as well as the fact that glacial collapse is not simple and does not happen that quickly as predicted by the IPCC. None of the simulations predicted the inland retreat of Thwaites  ice cliffs at the speed suggested by MICI. Instead when the ice sheet was not being held back by the ice shelf the glacier s movement toward the ocean accelerated rapidly causing its ice sheet to expand. The accelerated movement thinned ice at the edge of the glacier reducing cliff height and susceptibility to collapse.

Layoffs by the Trump administration at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have reached the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) a small but important institute that is responsible for climate models the world relies on.Started in 1955 GFDL is responsible for some of the planet s most highly regarded climate and weather models. They are relied upon for global heating projections as well as weather forecasting in the United States.Several of the workers who were fired were in charge of crucial projects and it is likely that several GFDL projects   including a new type of atmospheric model   will face delays as will more accurate regional climate predictions.The American Meteorological Society earlier this week warned that the firings  are likely to cause irreparable harm and have far-reaching consequences for public safety economic well-being and the United States  global leadership. Of special concern to GFDL is the latest version of its atmospheric model AM5. The new model is designed to run at higher frequencies and resolutions and allows for the use of long-term climate change code to be used in seasonal weather forecasts.

It s #NationalParkWeek from April 19 to April 27 but our Parks are still under attack!National Parks are a cornerstone of #America and the American experience. They serve as #nature preserves cultural beacons and educational #outreach for future #conservationists everywhere. Not to mention they make incredible #vacation spots and #travel destinations  . This week is a celebration of their history and cultural impact so the National Park Service is inviting you to join them! To kick off the celebration   entry is FREE on the 19th at any National Park so let s get exploring!Unfortunately there s something slimy in the water. Even while we celebrate the impact of National Parks the Trump administration has been working to destroy #nationalparks and the #NationalParkService as we know it. They re trying to allow #drilling cut funding and erase #LGBTQ contributions from the history books. But one group is fighting back hard: the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) is sounding the alarm!Over the last 100+ years the Parks have been something Americans can truly be proud of and the #NPCA intends to keep it that way! Founded in 1919 by OG Park Rangers they ve safeguarded the Parks and the National Park Service for over a century. Now they re rallying against the members of the House and Senate to make sure the parks they vowed to protect stay unblemished by government greed. They were literally made for this.   Want to help? Get loud! Make your voices heard! And make sure to visit one of the over 400(!!!) parks across the nation to show your support for these preserved natural spaces!  It is the people who must save their own national parks.  - Robert Sterling Yard co-founder of the NPCA.  editor: brynnerardin #nationalparks #nps #NationalParkWeek #yellowstone #glaciernationalpark #everglades #greatsmokymountains #yosemite #joshuatree #grandcanyon #NPCA #ecology #environment #conservation #ecowatch,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/04/ecowatch_18083504860642186.jpeg,0.12757,2025-04-14 18:30:00,reel,Posts_ecowatch_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_d967_CLEANED_121.jpeg
The amount of land needed for renewable energy projects is sometimes criticized but a new study points out that in countries like the United Kingdom and the United States much more land gets allocated for golf courses than renewable energy facilities.In the 10 countries in the world that have the most golf courses a course s area could support as much as 659 gigawatts (GW) of wind capacity and 842 GW of solar capacity which exceeds the installed capacity for many of the renewable energy facilities.Golf courses have an outsized environmental impact as they usually require chemical treatments and large amounts of water. On the other hand solar farms wind turbines and other renewable energy installations offer an option for sustainable land use that directly reduces greenhouse gas emissions.Roughly 0.01 square kilometers of land is required per megawatt (MW) for utility-scale solar farms while wind farms need 0.12 square kilometers for each MW though just a small fraction of the land is impacted by infrastructure and turbines.

An abnormally active typhoon season that hit the Philippines this year was  supercharged  by climate change according to a new attribution study published by the World Weather Attribution (WWA).The report found that climate change exacerbated the conditions that led to the typhoon season and made the formation of typhoons nearly twice as likely.The team noted that six major storms hit the country in less than a month including five typhoons and one major tropical cyclone   an anomaly compared to the three average typhoons the country experiences in an entire year.The storms which killed more than 170 people formed in 23 days from late October to mid-November each hitting Luzon the country s largest and most populated island and impacted more than 13 million people. Ben Clarke a researcher at the WWA and the Centre for Environmental Policy Imperial College London wrote in a press release  While it is unusual to see so many typhoons hit the Philippines in less than a month the conditions that gave rise to these storms are increasing as the climate warms.

The perfect introduction to the world of composting! Composting is the practice of intentionally breaking down organic substances   like food scraps   and turning it into compost essentially a nutrient-rich organic matter that is excellent for feeding plants. It also helps reduce methane emissions associated with food waste. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council  compost is an essential tool for improving large-scale agricultural systems  by improving soil health reducing erosion and conserving water.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also notes that using compost  attracts beneficial organisms to the soil and reduces the need for pesticides and fertilizers  as well as promotes carbon sequestration and subsequently climate resiliency!

An enormous landslide of rock and glacial ice in a Greenland fjord last year led to a seismic wave that  shook the Earth  for nine straight days. The landslide triggered a 656-foot  mega-tsunami  inside the narrow fjord where it moved back and forth generating vibrations felt by sensors all over the planet. Scientists say landslides like the one in Greenland are happening more often as climate change causes glaciers supporting Greenland s mountains to melt.The signal was traced to eastern Greenland. To locate the exact location the seismologists contacted their Denmark colleagues who had gotten reports of a tsunami generated by a landslide in remote Dickson Fjord.This led to a collaboration between 68 scientists from 15 countries over the course of almost a year. They sifted through satellite seismic and land-based data in addition to tsunami wave simulations to solve the mystery of the unidentified seismic object (USO).The ensuing tsunami wave that became trapped in the narrow fjord created a  seiche  or tightly enclosed wave moving rhythmically back and forth. Scientists had never known a seiche to last such a long time.With the Arctic warming four times faster than other parts of the globe since 1979 this could mean more frequent mega-tsunamis triggered by landslides in the region.

Nearly half of climate experts   44 percent   believe China s carbon dioxide emissions may have already peaked or will peak in 2025 at the latest according to a new report from think tank Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).China s carbon emissions are also on track to increase slightly this year despite fast progress on electric vehicles (EVs) and renewables.The third edition of the annual report China s Climate Transition: Outlook 2024 indicated increasing optimism about China s green transition.The 44 experts from industry and academia surveyed for this year s report were much more optimistic about China s carbon emissions peaking by next year than they were during last year s survey when just 21 percent had the same opinion.In the report CREA reassessed China s progress toward its climate and emissions commitments aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement.China has set a target of reaching peak carbon emissions by the end of the decade and overall carbon neutrality by 2060. A pledge from Beijing to  strictly control  coal use in the country s 14th  five-year plan  covers the period up until the end of next year.

Fueled by the climate crisis the global average temperature soared above the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold for the first time in 2024 intensifying extreme weather.Experts from the United Nations World Meteorological Organization (WMO) have confirmed that last year was the planet s hottest on record reaching 1.55 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average.Four out of six of the international datasets analyzed by WMO showed a global average temperature for 2024 that was higher than 1.5 degrees Celsius while two did not.The 1.5 degrees Celsius average is the goal temperature threshold of the 2015 Paris Agreement with an overall target of temperatures worldwide remaining  well below  two degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average.WMO maintained that the Paris Agreement was  not yet dead but in grave danger  explaining that the long-term temperature goals of the accord were measured across decades not individual years.

A new study has found high concentrations of perfluoroalkyl acids or PFAA in sea spray. In fact researchers noted that the levels of PFAAs in sea spray aerosols were even higher than in seawater itself and the researchers estimated that emissions of PFAAs from sea spray could be even greater than those in the atmosphere from manufacturing sources and other known polluters  The study looked at PFAAs that are remobilized from seawater into sea spray via field studies of the Atlantic Ocean between the UK and Chile. Researchers Bo Sha and Jana Johansson used a sea spray emulator and worked from a ship for two months according to Sha. They found that PFAA concentrations in the sea spray were over 100000 times greater than the amount of PFAAs in the water itself.PFAS (per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances) are chemical compounds that do not break down in the environment and have been linked to human health risks including elevated risks of certain types of cancer as well as potential environmental impacts as they bioaccumulate in wildlife. PFAAs in particular are common in firefighting foams food packaging and waterproof and stain-repellent materialsAccording to the study authors an estimated 49 tons of PFOA and 26 tons of PFOS are emitted each year from sea spray aerosols compared to an estimated 1 to 1.4 tons of PFOS emitted into the air annually from industrial sources. The amount of PFOA emissions from sea spray is also comparable to the up to 74 tons of PFOA in the atmosphere from various known emitters as of 2012 the authors wrote in the study.The scientists noted that these findings raise health concerns for people in coastal regions. They also suggested that their estimates in the study could fall short of the actual amount of PFAAs moving through to coastal regions.  Link in bio.

According to a new analysis by Carbon Brief the United Kingdom s 2024 emissions fell to 409 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) based on preliminary energy data. That s a 3.6 percent drop and the lowest level since 1872.The country s coal use was also the lowest it s been since the mid-1600s.While UK emissions are currently 54 percent below 1990 levels the country s gross domestic product has increased by 84 percent.Some of the major contributors to the reduction in coal use were the closure of the country s last coal-fired power plant in Nottinghamshire as well as Wales  Port Talbot steelworks one of the UK s last blast furnaces. An almost 40 percent increase in electric vehicles (EV) on UK roads was another contributing factor along with above-average temperatures and electricity in the UK being the  cleanest ever  last year.To reach its 2035 climate goal as well as its target of net-zero by 2050 the UK s emissions would need to be cut more each year than they were in 2024.

Whales are important for healthy oceans. They move tons of deep-water nutrients to the surface when they poop and according to new research they also transport massive amounts of nutrients from Alaska to Hawaii in their urine.Fifteen years ago scientists discovered that whale poop provided a crucial resource for the growth of plankton contributing to ocean productivity a press release from the University of Vermont (UVM) said.Now a new UVM-led study has found that whales carry large amounts of nutrients across entire ocean basins   from the cold waters of their feeding grounds to the warm seas where they mate and birth their calves near the equator. Most of the nutrients are transported through their urine with carcasses sloughed skin placentas and calf feces also contributing.The researchers calculated that throughout the world s oceans great whales   including gray whales humpbacks and right whales   move roughly 4000 tons of nitrogen annually to tropical and subtropical low-nutrient coastal areas.These massive whales also bring over 45000 tons of biomass. Before whaling by humans decimated whale populations at least three times more nutrients might have been transported these incredible distances.

President Donald Trump s  drill baby drill  call for a resurgence in United States oil production will be frustrated by the reluctance of Wall Street to approve another frenzy according to shale bosses reported the Financial Times.U.S. oil and gas output during Trump s second term will increase by less than 1.3 million barrels of oil a day Wood Mackenzie and Rystad Energy said well below the nearly two barrels a day rise under Joe Biden.This could be a big letdown for the new president who is expecting a surge in oil supply to lower U.S. inflation by making fuel and goods less expensive.Oil production in the U.S. reached a record high in 2024 but the Energy Information Administration predicts output will only jump 2.6 percent this year to 13.6 million barrels a day before growing less than one percent the following year due to price pressures.After over a decade of exploration across North Dakota and Texas some shale producers are concerned that the best areas in the U.S. have already been tapped. Executives warned that Trump s unrelenting support of fossil fuels and deregulation may have a limited effect.

The Constitutional Court of Ecuador has determined that coastal marine ecosystems have rights of nature including the right to  integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycles structure functions and evolutionary processes  per Chapter 7 Articles 71 to 74 in the country s constitution.This is not the first time that Ecuador has established legal rights for nature. In fact Ecuador was the first country in the world to establish that nature held legal rights Earth.org reported. In 2008 Ecuador added rights for Pacha Mama an ancient goddess similar to the Mother Earth entity in its constitution. The law included a series of articles establishing that nature has the right to restoration and that the government will take precautions and restrictions against people harming or destroying ecosystems. This ruling is the first time that Ecuador s rights of nature have been applied to marine environments.  Link in bio.

Researchers in northwest Peru s Alto Mayo region have discovered 27 new animal species including a semi-aquatic mouse a salamander that climbs trees and a  blob-headed fish. The 38-day survey uncovered and recorded more than 2000 species of plants and wildlife.The expedition was led by a team of researchers from Conservation International who were joined by Indigenous scientists and guides from Global Earth as well as local experts from the Indigenous Regional Federation of the Alto Mayo Awajun Communities.Of the 2000 species they recorded 27 were new to science and nearly 50 are threatened with extinction. Four of the newly discovered species were mammals.The purpose of the expedition was to find the greatest number of species in a short time. The setting for this unique search was unusual however since the area has been scarred by deforestation and is full of human settlements rather than being the kind of  pristine  forest setting where an abundance of rare wildlife would be found.The expedition was the beginning of a plan to connect Alto Mayo s remaining patches of abundant biodiversity to create a conservation corridor for the long-term protection of the region s wildlife.

After 16 years of efforts by grassroots organizations local Puerto Rico communities are celebrating the establishment of the country s new marine protected area (MPA) Jardines Submarinos de Vega Baja y Manat .The new marine reserve on Puerto Rico s north coast will protect 77 square miles of marine biodiversity a press release from the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) said. The project was a collaboration between local communities authorities and environmental organizations.More than 14 endangered species live amongst the reserve s mangroves and seagrass beds including the Greater Caribbean Manatee. Beneath its blue-green waters is one of the largest Elkhorn coral colonies in the Caribbean as well as a variety of other coral species and endangered and threatened marine life.A local ecotourism industry and small-scale fisheries flourish in the area and local communities have hope that the formal co-management of the Jardines sanctuary as an MPA will safeguard its waters as a thriving source of income and food for generations to come.Community leaders hope the success of the MPA inspires others to conserve their natural wonders.The next step for the Jardines MPA will be developing a co-management strategy.

Global sea temperatures reached an all-time high in 2024 according to a new study published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences. The 54 researchers from seven countries deployed thousands of instruments to collect ocean data both at the surface and up to 2000 meters below the surface   the latter called ocean heat content   covering all the world s oceans. The researchers found that all three major metrics they analyzed broke records this year: global sea surface temperature average global sea surface temperature and the temperature of water up to 2000 meters below the surface. From 2023 to 2024 the researchers recorded an enormous increase of the upper 2000 meters of ocean heat content of 16 zettajoules. That increase represents about 140 times the world s total energy production in 2023.Ocean temperatures are a critical indicator of human-caused climate change. The vast majority   about 90%   of the Earth s excess heat from global warming is stored in the oceans. Warming oceans also tend to lead to more and more intense storms. The team plans to continue keeping track of ocean warming going forward.  Link in bio.  Michael Riojas.Sunset on a beach in Cadiz Spain on July 23 2024.

Have you heard of the spinning fish phenomenon happening in Florida? The first reports of spinning fish came in fall 2023 with smalltooth sawfish deaths beginning in January. Scientists including those at the Florida Fish and Wildfire Conservation Commission (FWC) quickly responded and were able to rule out red tide and dissolved oxygen issues as the cause of this outbreak. FWC took samples from more than 300 fish and conducted necropsies have been on 32 of the 45 dead sawfish. Right now everything is pointing to what is likely a naturally occurring species or multiple species of algae that produce low levels of toxins. These are neurotoxins that would be consistent with the behavioral changes observed. Gil McRae director of the commission s Fish and Wildlife Research Institute said that a recent decrease in incidents of spinning fish could be a sign that  we re on the tail end of this event.  But the official cause of the erratic behavior remains unclear. : brynnerardin.#ecowatchers #climatenews #climatechange #globalwarming  #florida #floridakeys #sawfish #fish #ocean #algae #endangered,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/06/ecowatch_18345688789117725.jpeg,0.10673,2024-06-09 19:15:00,reel,Posts_ecowatch_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_d967_CLEANED_141.jpeg

A recent analysis of the Amazon Rainforest has revealed that while deforestation declined in 2024 the level of degradation from factors like wildfires and logging increased 497% in the same time period.According to Amazon Institute of People and the Environment (Imazon) a nonprofit and research institute based in Brazil deforestation or the complete clearing of vegetation declined by 7% in 2024 compared to 2023. This marked the second consecutive year of declining deforestation numbers.However over 36379 square kilometers of the rainforest were degraded last year compared to the 6092 square kilometers affected by land degradation in 2023. Degradation in 2024 was the highest since 2009 Imazon reported.Forest fires were a major contributor to land degradation according to Imazon. The Rainforest Foundation reported that 2024 had the highest number of fires in the Brazilian Amazon since 2005 burning an area of land larger than the state of California. Experts expect some relief from fires over the winter when higher rainfall will keep degradation from wildfires at bay. But they also emphasize a need for more conservation areas to reduce other degradation factors such as logging.  Link in bio.

Human-driven climate change is causing temperatures to rise to dangerous new heights while worsening drought and impeding food security according to the ninth Lancet Countdown report.The report by health experts and doctors warned that people all over the world are facing unparalleled health threats because of the climate crisis.It was found that extreme droughts of one month or more in 2023 affected 48 percent of the land on Earth with people having to cope with 50 added days of dangerous temperatures because of global heating.Last year extreme temperatures and drought led to 151 million more people having to face moderate to severe food insecurity   in comparison with 1981 to 2010   causing health risks like malnutrition.The elderly are particularly vulnerable to the rising temperatures with heat-related deaths for those over 65 last year 167 percent higher than in the 1990s. The report said that without climate change they would have predicted that number to increase by 65 percent.The authors of the study encouraged leaders at next month s United Nations COP29 climate summit to direct climate financing toward public health.

The annual Global Energy Monitor (GEM) survey Boom and Bust Coal has found that coal-fired operating capacity worldwide rose by two percent last year   the highest annual increase since 2016  China was responsible for two-thirds of the expansion with a small amount of growth in other parts of the globe. Beyond the additions in China new capacity coming online in India Indonesia Vietnam Pakistan Japan Bangladesh South Korea Zimbabwe and Greece drove the increase.According to Global Coal Plant Tracker data 69.5 gigawatts (GW) of coal capacity were commissioned in 2023 while 21.1 GW were retired   a net yearly increase of 48.4 GW and a total capacity worldwide of 2130 GW.Outside of China a total of 22.1 GW were commissioned with 17.4 GW retired   a net increase of 4.7 GW. Since the 2015 Paris Agreement 25 countries have reduced their coal-fired capacity while 35 have increased it.Last year marked the lowest retirement of coal capacity of any year in over a decade.Lower coal plant retirements last year in Europe and the United States contributed to the uptick in operating capacity. Nearly half of retirements in 2023 were in the U.S.   9.7 GW   down from the country s record high of 21.7 GW in 2015.While most global coal operating capacity is currently under some sort of net zero or similar pledge 1626 GW   75 percent   continues to be without a closure commitment.

Chief Executive Officer of the United Nations COP29 Climate Change Conference Elnur Soltanov has been recorded by Global Witness apparently agreeing to help facilitate fossil fuel industry deals at the summit. A member of the campaign organization posed as a fake oil and gas representative offering to sponsor the event in exchange for assistance with the deals.Soltanov who is also Azerbaijan s deputy energy minister promised  to create a contact between yourself and [SOCAR]  so that they can start discussions. Soltanov suggested that Global Witness  fake investment group EC Capital  incorporate your activities with SOCAR s activity during COP so that you can  talk business to them and also participate in the COP29 process. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) expects officials to act  without self-interest  and says they should not use their official roles  to seek private gain Global Witness recorded Soltanov telling the imposter oil and gas group that SOCAR was  trading oil and gas all over the world including in Asia.

Electricity in the United Kingdom was the cleanest ever in 2024 with solar and wind generating all-time highs. A new report has found that per unit carbon dioxide emissions have fallen by over two-thirds in a decade within the UK. The analysis attributed this to the phasing out of coal in the UK which now generates less than half the amount of electricity from fossil fuels than it did a decade ago. Meanwhile the generation of power from renewable sources has more than doubled.Fossil fuels made up 29 percent of electricity generation in the UK last year   the lowest level ever recorded   with renewables accounting for a record 45 percent nuclear and biomass each generating roughly 13 percent imports 11 percent and solar producing four percent.This resulted in each unit of electricity generating an average of 124 grams of carbon compared with 419 grams of  carbon intensity  for each kilowatt hour in 2014.The analysis said wind was  expected to form the backbone of the nation s electricity system by 2030 . The Labour government has pledged to decarbonize electricity in the UK by then with ambitious plans to ramp up solar and wind.

In a new study scientists analyzed UK crops and how the country s agriculture could be affected by climate change and predicted what could be the top crops by 2080.Led by the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH) in collaboration with the University of East Anglia (UEA) the study determined that a changing climate could mean that the UK will become more suitable for growing crops like soy chickpeas grapes oranges and okra.At the same time the region could become less suitable to growing its current crops including oats wheat onions and strawberries meaning agriculture could face significant challenges and high costs to adapt to growing different crops.Scientists explored how suitable 160 different crops   both currently grown in the UK and ones that would be new to the area   could be under two different scenarios: 2 degrees Celsius warming and 4 degrees Celsius warming compared to pre-industrial levels.As the study pointed out introducing more crops and diversifying local agriculture could improve soil health and lead to improved natural pest and disease control plus high suitability for proteins like soy beans and chickpeas could reduce meat consumption and related emissions.

What s all the buzz about?  Scientists have studied the nutritional profiles of 57 varieties of pollen and discovered that in order to have a balanced diet of essential amino and fatty acids bees must forage from a wide array of plants.The world s agricultural systems are dependent on bees as essential pollinators. At the same time bees and plants are interdependent   bees need pollen from plants for sustenance and many plants reproduce by bees spreading their pollen. Nectar provides bees with carbohydrates while pollen gives them critical nutrients like proteins and lipids. Human-caused environmental changes that alter pollen s natural properties and availability risk causing malnourishment in bees.Bees need high-quality foods that contain fatty acids like omega-3 and omega-6 that are non-esterified. Without them bees don t live as long are less able to deal with environmental stressors and have weaker immune systems. Consuming nutrients in the wrong ratio can lead to cognitive issues. Amino acids are necessary for reproduction and cognitive health in bees but eating too many of them can make them more susceptible to some parasites.Results from the scientific study indicated that foraging for food from a wide variety of flowers is healthiest for most bees and that endemic plant species offer no nutritional advantage over non-native plants. Most pollen species provide the majority of needed nutrients but for optimal dietary needs bees need to visit several different plant species.

With global average temperatures expected to continue to rise in the coming decades scientists have projected that warming will significantly harm global agriculture as it weakens crop yields and disrupts food production. Now new research finds that warming will disrupt many of Earth s major crops and harm global crop diversity.The study conducted by researchers at Aalto University in Finland analyzed 30 of the world s most important crops and modeled how climate change is likely to affect their safe climatic space under different potential global warming scenarios.The researchers found that crops growing at lower latitudes or closer to the equator will be hardest hit as those areas continue to get hotter and more arid.For each of the 30 crops the researchers established their  safe climatic space  which can be likened to a Goldilocks zone of optimal growth using average precipitation aridity and temperature. As warming increases the researchers found the safe climatic space for crops tends to move farther and farther away from the equator and if warming goes beyond 1.5 degrees it could threaten  up to half  of the world s crops at lower latitudes.

Stronger water management efforts will be essential to overcoming the gap between supply and demand as the planet continues to warm according to a new analysis by Lorenzo Rosa principal investigator at Carnegie Science and Matteo Sangiorgio a researcher at the Polytechnic University of Milan.For the study the pair of researchers quantified issues of water scarcity under 1.5 and three degrees Celsius of global heating above pre-industrial levels.When water consumption is greater than the natural availability of water at any time during a month it is referred to as a  water gap.  As time goes on this kind of unsustainable use leads to depleted rivers lakes aquifers groundwater and other natural water reserves.Sangiorgio and Rosa quantified water gaps for scenarios under baseline 1.5 and 3 degrees Celsius of warming accounting for factors such as surface and groundwater depletion and water requirements for aquatic ecosystems.The findings showed that there are already almost 458 billion cubic meters in water gaps annually. They are predicted to grow by 6% under a 1.5 degrees Celsius warming scenario and by 15% if the planet warms by 3 degrees Celsius.

Prices may soon increase at the pump due to tariffs on gas imported from Mexico and Canada enacted by President Donald Trump.President of Mexico Claudia Sheinbaum has reached a deal with the Trump administration to delay the tariffs for a month while import duties on Canadian and Chinese goods will go into effect early February. The impact of the tariffs could harm oil companies and increase gas prices. As a reason for imposing the tariffs Trump cited a national emergency related to undocumented immigrants coming into the U.S. as well as the flow of the drug fentanyl into the country reported CNN. Trump has said he will use the tariffs to raise revenue bring other nations to the negotiating table and balance trade.But economists have warned the tariffs would have a negative impact on U.S. consumers and businesses. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Saturday said the duties would not solve border issues but would instead threaten supply chains while raising prices for Americans.About a third of American imports come from Mexico Canada and China including fruits and vegetables electronics meat clothing toys gas lumber beer and spirits.

The report A Threat to Progress: Confronting the effects of climate change on child health and well-being found that 466 million children   one in five children in the world   are exposed to this unprecedented level of excessive heat.The researchers compared average temperatures in the 1960s to those from 2020 to 2024   with extremely hot days being those that were more than 95 degrees Fahrenheit   and found that they had increased for nearly half a billion children around the world many of whom did not have the services or infrastructure to cope.The analysis looked at data by country and found that in 16 nations children today are subjected to an additional month-plus of extremely hot days in comparison with six decades ago. Excessive heat stress can contribute to non-communicable diseases like heat-related illnesses malnutrition in children and can make children more susceptible to infectious diseases like malaria and dengue that spread easily in high temperatures. Extreme heat also impacts mental health neurodevelopment and overall wellbeing.When extreme heat goes on for longer periods its effects are compounded. Children in more than half of the 100 countries surveyed were found to experience twice the number of heat waves now than 60 years ago and these extremely hot temperatures are increasing in every country around the world.

The death toll from Hurricane Helene has rose to at least 200. Helicopters searched for survivors above washed-out bridges while rescuers hiked through the wilderness.After pummeling Florida s Gulf Coast the powerful Category 4 storm dumped over 40 trillion gallons of rainfall   enough to fill up Lake Tahoe   throughout the southern United States. The deluge created a catastrophic mixture of flooding mudslides and disruptions to power internet and water supplies.The death toll in North Carolina was at least 74 while South Carolina reported 39 fatalities. In Georgia the death toll reached 33 according to Gov. Brian Kemp. 14 deaths were reported in Florida two in Virginia and four in Tennessee local authorities and reports from media compiled by AFP said.

Over the last century urbanization and industrialization combined with poor waste management has led to an alarming rise in the amount of pollution in our soils waterways groundwater and air. Heavy metal toxins from industrial production chemicals from the agriculture sector untreated wastewater plastic pollution crude oil leaks and spills toxins from the increasing wildfires and other pollutants need systems-level change. However natural processes in the environment do offer solutions.Bioremediation is a process by which plants and microbes that are already present in the environment   like fungi algae and bacteria   have the power to remove or reduce environmental pollution   even plastic pollution. While natural bioremediation has been around since the dawn of time (microbes were the earliest known life forms) modern bioremediation offers techniques that stimulate and augment these processes. While there are numerous bioremediation types there are also several processes that have been utilized and are either done in situ (at the place of contamination) or ex situ (off-site of the contamination).Head on over to the link in our bio to learn more! .

Construction has started in the UK on two of four new bison bridges that will enable the animals to cross through forested areas while allowing human visitors to observe the wildlife from the bridges above.The project totaling  1 million (about $1.33 million) includes four bridges that people can use to safely observe the UK s first wild bison herd in thousands of years according to Kent Wildlife Trust which alongside Wildwood Trust has been a leader of the wild bison restoration project in the UK.Kent Wildlife Trust reported that bison are labeled as dangerous under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976. This prevents bison from sharing the same spaces as humans. By installing pedestrian bridges the bison can have a greater range while the humans can watch and learn more about these creatures.With the bridges the bison will expand their roaming area from 50 hectares to around 200 hectares. Currently the bison are restricted to fenced regions because of the official dangerous wildlife designation.While the bridges help expand the range for the bison conservationists are hoping to push UK officials to update rewilding laws to allow for bison preservation and expansion projects that won t require expensive steel fencing.Two of the bridges are expected to be complete before the end of 2024.

Have you ever heard of  cli-fi  before? Climate fiction is a genre of fiction that emerged in the first decades of the 21st century in response to growing awareness of the climate crisis caused primarily by the burning of fossil fuels. As the term  cli-fi  suggests climate fiction was originally highly associated with science fiction and often features scientist protagonists or the latest climate science to offer imaginings or warnings of what the near or far future might look like if humans do or do not act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However as the impacts of climate change have intruded ever more into daily life the genre has evolved to include many works set in the present or near-present as well. Climate fiction is a diverse gathering of works that ranges from Hollywood disaster thrillers like The Day After Tomorrow to hard science fiction focused on technological and political change such as the works of Kim Stanley Robinson to introspective literary novels like Jenny Offill s Weather. Many writers and critics who engage with climate fiction see it as a way to alter our climate reality by offering a warning of a future to avoid or providing a roadmap toward a more just and sustainable society. Some argue that because people have a hard time empathizing with their future selves reading about and caring for characters contending with the climate crisis can help them make that imaginative leap and take action today.

EcoWatch s roving reporter Tiffany Duong (tiffmakeswaves) visited the WasteManagement   recycling facility in Pembroke Pines FL. It forever changed how she thinks of recycling. A few takeaways from her visit:   Not all plastics with the recycling symbol and a number in a triangle are recyclable. Check local regulations.   Wishcycling  makes us feel better but is worse for the planet because it contaminates the whole batch.  We need to think of recycling as an industry making a profit rather than a social service. If we do that we will treat recyclables as commodities rather than trash.   Of course using less is the best way. Reduce refuse and reuse!

In a new report researchers have ranked global cities for flood and drought risks and determined that some of the biggest cities in the world are facing dangerous climate swings between dry and wet periods. Some cities have seen a total change in their climate moving from typically dry regions to regions prone to flooding and vice versa according to the study.The report conducted by non-governmental organization WaterAid in collaboration with researchers from the University of Bristol and Cardiff University investigated the climate trends in the 100 most-populated cities globally as well as 12 cities where the NGO operates. In total 95% of the observed cities were experiencing a shift toward wetter or dryer climates. According to the findings 15% of the cities are experiencing climate  whiplash  where they face periods of drought almost immediately followed by flooding. The recent wildfires in Los Angeles were an example of such whiplash with wetter periods both before and after the fires. The rainy period increased vegetation growth which fueled larger fires. Now after the fires some people in Southern California are being evacuated amid wetter weather because of increased mudslide risks.The cities facing varying climate extremes face risk of infrastructure that cannot keep up with the shifts in wet or dry weather events.

In a new study scientists detected the presence of 10 target per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) including compounds such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in samples of tap water from the UK and China as well as in bottled waters from 15 countries.The study published in the journal ACS ES&T Water set out to determine potential exposure to some of the most common PFAS from water of various sources around the world. The study authors used 112 bottled water samples in both plastic and glass bottles with water sourced from 15 countries as well as 41 samples of tap water in homes of Birmingham Worcester Coventry and Derby UK and 14 water samples from homes in Shenzhen China.The team of researchers behind the study found PFOS and PFOA were most common in bottled water showing up in more than 99% of the bottled water samples. Other PFAS were detected in 67% to 93% of the bottled waters.The researchers also tested ways of filtering some of these PFAS and found simple methods that consumers could take from home until regulatory agencies can enhance PFAS monitoring for water.

A new study led by scientists from the University of Exeter has found that the risk of seabed creatures being exposed to plastics depends on how they feed and interact with their environment rather than simply reflecting pollution levels in their local area.All ocean plastic ends up sinking to the seafloor a richly biodiverse habitat. The marine species who live in this unique environment burrow into the sediment and process food in a variety of ways that determine their levels of plastic exposure. The research team found that seabed creatures living in parts of the ocean with high plastic pollution levels   particularly the Mediterranean and Yellow Seas   had ingested the most plastics.In 93 percent of studies microplastics were found in animals living on the seafloor.The researchers found that predators seabed scavengers called deposit feeders   as opposed to filter feeders   and omnivores were the most likely to take plastic into their bodies. Especially susceptible were marine animals like crabs as well as starfish sea urchins brittlestars sea cucumbers and squid.The findings of the study will assist scientists and policymakers with filling in knowledge gaps and focusing their actions as details of the Global Plastics Treaty are finalized  Link in bio.  cristenhemingwayjaynes.A sea urchin using electrician s tape as camouflage.

The Western monarch butterfly population in California has plummeted to a near-record low of less than 10000 this winter.The 28th annual Western Monarch Count   conducted by hundreds of partners and volunteers   reported a peak monarch population of 9119 overwintering butterflies. It was the second lowest on record since the count started in 1997.The count represents a steep decline from the more than 200000 overwintering Western monarchs observed during each of the past three years. The all-time low was fewer than 2000 recorded in 2020.The low number coincides with the proposed protection of monarchs under the U.S. Endangered Species Act by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).Since the 1980s the Western population of monarchs has declined by over 95 percent reported the Los Angeles Times. Back then it was estimated that as many as four million butterflies spent the winter in California. Unless urgent conservation efforts are taken FWS says Western monarchs face a 99 percent chance of becoming extinct by 2080.

The United Kingdom s Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA) plans to invest 81 million pounds in the development of an ambitious early warning system designed to detect climate tipping points.The new system will use drones plankton bloom patterns and cosmic ray detection combined with artificial intelligence and detailed cutting-edge computer models.ARIA s early warning system program will be focused on two major tipping points: the collapse of the subpolar gyre (SPG) ocean current   a part of the crucial Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)   and the melting of Greenland s ice sheet.The collapse of ocean currents like AMOC would lead to global weather pattern changes triggering extreme weather and wreaking havoc on the world s food supplies while the collapse of Greenland s ice sheet would cause significant and potentially damaging sea level rise.At least 16 tipping points have been identified by scientists some of which may have already been passed from the thawing of permafrost in the north to a shift in west Africa s monsoon.ARIA hopes to come up with an early warning system capable of forecasting tipping points a decade ahead of time where possible.

Norwegian shipowner Eidesvik and W rtsil  a Finland-based engine manufacturer have signed a contract to make a platform supply vessel (PSV) that can run on ammonia fuel.W rtsil    the company supplying the equipment to convert the ship   said the Viking Energy vessel will be the first in the world to run on ammonia.The shipping industry has been exploring several alternative fuels including ammonia to reduce carbon emissions. Norway s Equinor is also financing the ship s conversion to ammonia   a fuel that doesn t produce greenhouse gases   in early 2026 and is projected to begin operating on ammonia by mid-year.W rtsil  made its first engine that runs on ammonia available for orders in the fourth quarter of last year. The company told Reuters that the new technology could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 70 percent in comparison with similar diesel-based fuels.For the future of the shipping industry ammonia and hydrogen are considered the two major zero emissions fuel possibilities the press release said. Ammonia is believed by many to be the best choice for longer voyages like supply routes through the North Sea where ships must have large amounts of fuel with them  Link in bio.  cristenhemingwayjaynes.The Viking Energy vessel will become the first to run on ammonia.

The government of the United Kingdom has announced a record flood protection package that includes an additional 250 million pounds to better protect tens of thousands of England s homes and businesses.As part of the government s Plan for Change it is committing 2.65 billion pounds over two years to fund flood defenses for 52000 properties by March of 2026 a press release from the UK government said. The record funding will also include needed maintenance at an additional 14500 properties.The announcement came as the government s Floods Resilience Taskforce met. Ministers joined representatives from Local Resilience Forums the National Farmers  Union and the Met Office.They explored potential further steps to protect the more than six million properties that are at risk of flooding in England.As many as 1000 projects will receive a portion of the investment program funds. Some of the funding   140 million pounds   will be put toward 31 projects on a priority basis.With the climate crisis contributing to increasing weather extremes including more frequent flooding a growing number of homes and businesses are projected to be affected by flooding in the future.

Scientists have estimated that bowhead whales   the longest-living whale species   can live more than 200 years.It was once thought that the bowhead s cousin the right whale had an average lifespan of about 70 to 80 years but new research has revised that estimate to more than 130 years   nearly twice as long!The researchers worked with Indigenous subsistence hunters from Utqia vik Alaska. They used chemical analysis of bowhead whales that had been killed to demonstrate that they are able to live more than two centuries. The chemical evidence was corroborated by harpoon tips from the 19th century being recovered from bowheads killed during modern hunts.Additionally the team looked at four decades of data that had been collected through photo identification programs tracking critically endangered North Atlantic right whales   who live along North America s Atlantic coast   and Southern right whales found south of the equator. Their analysis showed that Southern right whales can live longer than 130 years   with some possibly living to 150 years   rather than the 70 to 80 years that had been previously thought.

As global warming worsens green spaces in urban areas will play an important role in providing respite. According to a new analysis these urban green spaces will be crucial in preventing heat-related deaths which have been on the rise in recent years.The analysis reviewed a selected 12 studies on the influence of urban green spaces on heat-related diseases and deaths published from January 2000 to December 2022. The studies took place in Hong Kong Australia Vietnam the U.S. South Korea Portugal and Japan.According to the analysis green spaces showed to improve health for residents of urban areas and these green spaces were particularly beneficial to vulnerable populations including elderly adults and children.Studies in Australia and Japan revealed that adding more vegetation to urban spaces could reduce heat including by 0.5 to 2 degrees Celsius in Melbourne Central Business District specifically as well as reduce mortality rates related to heat stress. Further the analysis determined that urban green spaces could reduce heat-related diseases and deaths as well as provide economic value.The authors of the study have recommended that officials consider expanding access to public cooling and hydration centers to mitigate heat-related deaths.

According to a new report from BloombergNEF global clean power costs could fall between 2% and 11% this year despite tariffs.Even with potential trade barriers the  Levelized Cost of Electricity  report estimated that clean energy costs for technologies such as wind solar and battery storage will decrease 22% to 49% by 2035. Much of these cost savings are made possible through China s rapid clean energy technology manufacturing capacity. According to the report China can produce a megawatt-hour of clean energy at 11% to 64% lower costs than other markets.The current U.S. administration may soon move forward with tariffs on Mexico and Canada which could also impact electricity prices and nuclear energy production in the U.S.But despite these trade barriers the report had a positive outlook for clean energy prices globally. Already battery storage costs globally fell by one-third in 2024 and fixed-axis solar farm rates decreased 21%. Battery storage is expected to fall further from a benchmark of $104 per megawatt-hour to below $100 per megawatt-hour and solar and wind energy generation is expected to decreased by 2% to 4%.

Now more than ever the ecological community is focused on hope. The late psychologist   C.R. Snyder suggests that this motivational mindset is a state of being that can actually be developed through a cognitive process. His three conditions for hope to exist and thrive are:   Goals: having something to hope for Pathways: finding multiple ways to achieve a goal including ways to overcome obstacles  Agency: believing you can make change happen.According to Snyder hopeful people think in a way that generates many actionable pathways to achieve goals. As we move forward in this period of uncertainty together we can focus on the goals pathways and agency we create together to achieve what might otherwise feel hopeless..  editor: brynnerardin .#ecowatchers #climatenews #climatechange #globalwarming #threeconditionsofhope #hope #goals #pathways #agency #snyder,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/01/ecowatch_18076475083636022.jpeg,0.08195,2025-01-08 18:30:00,reel,Posts_ecowatch_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_d967_CLEANED_177.jpeg

In their first 2 years I.CARE has transplanted over 15000 corals of varying species and educated over 2500 participants on the importance of coral reef communities. This event not only served as a way to help clean our seas but also as a fundraiser to help I.CARE continue its work on our reefs.Be sure to dive in for next year s derby!  : sonnysluiter .#ecowatchers #climatenews #climatechange #globalwarming  #florida #floridakeys #ocean #scuba #cleanup #trash,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/05/ecowatch_17913184355937332.jpeg,0.08005,2024-05-25 18:30:00,reel,Posts_ecowatch_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_d967_CLEANED_178.jpeg
Devastating flooding in the Midwestern states of Nebraska Iowa South Dakota and Minnesota killed at least two people in June as more rain and storms are predicted in the region.Flood waters have begun to recede in some rivers in areas of Wisconsin Iowa Minnesota Nebraska and South Dakota but more storms will continue to heighten river levels for at least the next couple of weeks.Brandon Buckingham AccuWeather meteorologist said severe thunderstorms with possible tornadoes would pop up from North Dakota to New Mexico with parts of Montana Colorado and North Dakota expected to experience  numerous severe thunderstorms with some packing wind gusts of 60-70 mph large hail and perhaps a few tornadoes. Amidst the raging floodwaters in Minnesota one white frame house barely holding onto the edge of a riverbank collapsed into the Blue Earth River near the Rapidan Dam.According to experts the damage and continuing future risk highlighted the country s deteriorating dams and the potential dangers they pose when faced with extreme conditions.The average age of a dam in the United states is nearly 60 so issues concerning these aging structures are predicted to multiply as the climate crisis wears on.

According to the European Union s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) the summer of 2024 was the planet s warmest on record for the Northern Hemisphere.The extreme heat of this year s boreal summer   June to August   means it is more likely that the average global temperature for the entire year will be hotter than that of 2023.This summer s average global temperature was 0.69 degrees Celsius higher than the period 1991 to 2020 surpassing last year s average of 0.66 degrees Celsius above the temperature for that period.August was 1.51 degrees Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial average and marks the 13th month out of the last 14 during which the world s average surface air temperature was higher than the benchmark of 1.5 degrees Celsius above which the planet begins to experience the worst effects of climate change.In the past 12 months the average global temperature was 1.64 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average   the highest ever recorded for any 12-month period.If humans do not urgently lower their greenhouse gas emissions temperature-related weather extremes will only become more intense with more devastating consequences for people and the planet.

Thank you George Washington Carver for helping formerly enslaved black farmers throughout the south learn how to grow food sustainably for their families and free themselves from the oppression of share cropping. Carver understood that the interconnectedness between the health of the land and the people and he used his work to help many find freedom and sustainable livelihoods from the land. Fun fact: Carver is most well known for discovering over 300 uses for peanuts from soap to wood stains to cooking oils! Happy Black History Month.

A team of researchers has developed a more sustainable and affordable way to recycle metal found in electronic waste.Researchers used electrothermal chlorination or flash Joule heating (FJH) and carbochlorination to save several metals from e-waste by heating a material with an electric current.The team used a programmable current that could control temperatures from room temperature to 2400 degrees Celsius that allows for free energy formation of metal chlorides. As explained in the study  Once conversion to a specific metal chloride is achieved that compound distills from the mixture in seconds. This allows both thermodynamic and kinetic selectivity for desired metals with minimization of impurities. This process allowed the researchers to collect multiple different metals including tantalum sourced from capacitors gallium from diodes and indium from old solar conductive film. Not only were the researchers able to extract these valuable metals from old electronic parts but they also had a yield of more than 85% and metal purity levels of more than 95%.  Link in bio.

Ten of Spain s top fashion companies   like the owner of Zara Inditex H&M IKEA Decathlon and Primark   will begin collecting discarded clothing beginning in April of 2025 as part of a year-long trial to manage textile waste.Re-viste the project s organizer said shoes clothing and other textiles will be separated from regular waste so that they can be recycled or reused.The voluntary program is in anticipation of European Union regulations that are expected to begin in 2026.Marta Gomez quality and environmental evaluation director at Spain s ministry of energy transition told fashion heads at a Madrid event that Spain is waiting for the new EU regulations to be approved before the country issues rules for fashion companies.Sources from the fashion industry and government officials said the new rules won t come into force until companies have had a minimum of one year to adjust.The effect of the new rules will be that the more clothing and shoes a company sells the more they are likely to have to pay to manage the resulting waste.

With the holidays in full swing there are more occasions for eating and drinking to excess which gives us multiple opportunities to curb our food waste.Food waste is an enormous global problem. According to a 2024 report from the United Nations Environment Program households throughout the world wasted an average of more than one billion meals per day in 2022. Meanwhile 783 million people were impacted by hunger and one-third faced food insecurity.When we waste food we also waste valuable resources. When we throw away food we re also throwing away the land water and energy used to produce that food  said Pete Pearson vice president of food loss and waste at WWF.Pearson suggested taking measures to avoid throwing good food away this holiday season by preparing  just enough  food for your guests. Other tips included composting food scraps encouraging people to take leftovers home storing leftovers in the freezer for when you re ready to revisit them and using leftovers to make new dishes.

Whale whale whale  what do we have here?  Ever heard of the #SilverBank? Nestled in the turquoise waters of the #DominicanRepublic this pristine #marinesanctuary becomes a winter paradise for thousands of North #Atlantic #humpback #whales (yes thousands  !) who flock to this spot every year from January to April.This is where the #magic happens: courtship mating calving and nurturing newborns until they re strong enough to journey back to the Northeastern U.S. It s also a safe haven for mothers and calves shielding them from apex predators in these #protectedwaters. Because of this between 5000 - 7000 whales #migrate to these warm waters every year making the Silver Bank likely the largest seasonal population of #humpbackwhales in the world!Silver Bank is one of only three places on #Earth   where you can #swim and #snorkel alongside these gentle giants and only three expert operators are licensed to take you. They all follow strict guidelines to keep the experience ethical and low-impact.Here s the coolest part: ecowatch s very own brynnerardin used to work on one of these vessels back in 2018 and has firsthand stories of swimming with these majestic creatures!

Think you re to blame for the climate crisis? A little bit sure but really it s a problem much bigger than any single one of us. A new report by Carbon Majors shows that half   yes half     of the world s CO2 emissions   comes from just 36 fossil fuel firms. The Carbon Majors data has been used to support new laws in New York and Vermont seeking compensation for climate damages from fossil fuel companies.  Other legal groups have also used the data as support for potential criminal charges against fossil fuel executives and investing firms (for misleading investors).

All over the world floods have been increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change.A new study led by researchers at University of British Columbia (UBC) shows that protecting key ecosystems across Canada could reduce the risk of flooding in over half of urban areas in the country that are at high risk.The study presents a global roadmap for the integration of nature-based solutions into flood management and urban planning.The research demonstrates that protecting the most essential five percent of watersheds which equates to roughly two percent of Canada s total land   201000 square kilometers   can greatly reduce the amount of rainwater runoff protect croplands and safeguard homes and livelihoods.The research team used global data to analyze how land types such as wetlands forests and riparian zones reduce runoff and absorb water.These natural systems improve water quality support wildlife and prevent downstream flooding while lowering the reliance on dams and other destructive and costly infrastructure.

A new study by Climate Central has found that human-caused climate change caused Atlantic hurricanes to become roughly 18 miles per hour (mph) stronger in the past six years.About 80 percent of hurricanes generated in the Atlantic Basin from 2019 to 2023 had maximum wind speeds that were 18 mph higher on average due to sea surface temperatures made warmer by global heating.Thirty of 38 hurricanes the researchers analyzed were approximately one category higher in intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in comparison with what their strength would have been projected to be without the influence of climate change.The report found that every hurricane originating in the Atlantic last year was intensified by the climate crisis.Three storms   Lorenzo in 2019 Ian in 2022 and last year s Lee   became Category 5 hurricanes because of climate change.

The National Marine Sanctuary Foundation (marinesanctuaryfdn) recently announced a milestone with the removal of 100000 pounds of marine debris from NOAA s Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary through the Goal: Clean Seas Florida Keys program. For scale that s more than the weight of two humpback whales or three full-sized school buses!Established in 2018 Goal: Clean Seas Florida Keys is a community-led partnership between Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary the Foundation and local dive operators to remove underwater marine debris from the waters of the Keys and engage and educate the public about its role in marine debris prevention. Cortney Benson Marine Debris Removal Stewardship Coordinator at the National Marine Sanctuary Foundation said  I am beyond proud of the Blue Star Dive Operators and both the professional and recreational divers for accomplishing this monumental feat. This work makes a difference not only for the reefs and biodiversity under the water but for the recreation economy of the Keys which rely on thriving sanctuary ecosystems.  Marine debris is one of the greatest challenges facing our global ocean. It threatens marine wildlife and sensitive habitats and can create safety and navigational hazards for recreation tourism and fishing and pose risks to animals through ingestion or entanglement.#ecowatchers #climatenews #climatechange #globalwarming #ocean #oceanconservation #florida #floridakeys #marinedebris,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/11/ecowatch_17893796433031565.jpeg,0.07242,2024-11-26 18:30:00,IMAGE,Posts_ecowatch_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_d967_CLEANED_192.jpeg
Researchers have determined multiple ways that harvested fog could help meet water demand in arid cities particularly those within the driest area on Earth the Atacama Desert. From providing drinking water to irrigating landscapes to supporting hydroponic gardening the new research shows promise in fog-harvesting technology.In the study published in Frontiers in Environmental Science scientists investigated the potential of fog collection in Alto Hospicio Chile an area threatened by water scarcity. The region receives less than 0.19 inches or 5 millimeters of rain per year. Further the Alto Hospicio region relies on underground aquifers for drinking water and those aquifers have not been replenished in 10000 to 17000 years.While fog harvesting for water has been considered previously the study authors noted that this method is typically considered for rural areas. However the scientists found that fog harvesting could also supplement the water supply in larger urban areas.Researchers used Standard Fog Collectors (SFC) originally described in a 1994 study to capture fog and measure the water harvested from it. They found that they could harvest an average of about 0.2 to 4.9 liters of water from fog per square meter per day within a total area spanning 100 square kilometers.These insights allowed the researchers to explore potential use cases for this water especially if governments place the SFCs in areas with higher fog potential. However the authors wrote that the fog water quality will be dependent on air quality so testing will be important in evaluating the potability of the harvested water. Further cities would need to invest in infrastructure to collect store and distribute the collected water.   Link in bio.

The COP29 United Nations Climate Conference extended into overtime as the offer by the world s richest countries of $250 billion annually by 2035 to assist poorer nations struggling with the most dire effects of the climate crisis was rejected as inadequate.Representatives from nearly 200 nations at the summit in Baku Azerbaijan have been given the goal of coming to an agreement on a financing plan to deal with climate change. However deep divides created by the world s richest governments not wanting to pay as much and developing nations pressing for more have mired the talks.A European negotiator told Reuters that the draft deal figure by the summit presidency was  uncomfortably high  and did not adequately expand the number of contributing countries.Nations that would need to lead the financing after a final deal is reached include the United States the European Union Australia Britain Japan Canada Norway Switzerland and New Zealand.The draft deal also invited voluntary contributions from developing countries.

Black History Month may be over but it deserves to be celebrated all year round! Thank you Brigadier General Charles Young for your lifetime of service to our country. As the first Black U.S. National Park Superintendent General Young and his troops helped to protect and preserve Sequoia National Park in California from poaching and illegal logging. They also helped to create the roadways found within the park today. Many forget the role that our military has played in protecting our most important natural spaces but it is thanks to their efforts that we have 30 national parks in the U.S. today.Please continue to educate yourselves on the impact that Black environmentalists and conservationists have had on our country throughout history. : brynnerardin,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/03/ecowatch_18047207597520357.jpeg,0.06855,2025-03-01 21:22:00,reel,Posts_ecowatch_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_d967_CLEANED_196.jpeg
Thank you Harriet Tubman for so much! She s known for her heroic role in the Underground Railroad   leading 70 enslaved people to freedom   but people are less aware of how her skills and deep knowledge of Chesapeake Bay contributed to her success. While working on the wharves and in the fields and woods Tubman learned to use the waterways to her advantage: to hunt for food read the stars and use the natural environment to protect herself and those she brought with her on their journey to freedom from slave catchers. She remains one of the truest representations of what it means to be an environmentalist   someone who understands how the environment has a primary influence on our growth and development as human beings.Happy Black History Month.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency s (EPA) 50th annual Automotive Trends Report model year (MY) 2023 electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles have led to an 11% decline in carbon dioxide emissions from new vehicles.The report noted that fuel economy reached a record high and greenhouse gas emissions from new vehicles reached a record low for MY 2023 vehicles in part thanks to EVs. Further the report found that all 14 of the major automotive manufacturers were meeting the light-duty greenhouse gas program requirements set by the EPA for the MY 2023 vehicles. The program requires MY 2023 through MY 2026 vehicles to prioritize vehicle technology that reduces pollution and emissions. According to the EPA the light-duty greenhouse gas program could save more than 3 billion tons of emissions by 2050.The reduction in carbon emissions has also been accompanied by an increase in vehicle fuel economy which has risen 40% since MY 2004. For MY 2023 vehicles alone new vehicle fuel economy reached a record high of 27.1 miles per gallon.   Link in bio.

Let s dive on in to the world of aquaculture!  When you think of agriculture the first images that come to mind might include big red barns full of hay a flock of fuzzy sheep or an orchard of apple trees. But agriculture isn t just all the flora fauna and equipment that puts land-based food to our plates. It can also include everything we hunt and consume under the sea.Aquaculture is a subsector within the agriculture industry. Humans working in this field cultivate or farm livestocks of aquatic species   anything from sea urchins crabs and kelp to salmon and tuna  for consumption. Around 580 aquatic species are harvested through aquaculture methods. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) global aquaculture production in 2020 included 87.5 million tonnes of aquatic animals that mainly went toward human consumption and 35.1 million tonnes of algae including seaweed for  food and non-food uses.

Sometimes sound tells a story. And what it says can be used to educate and improve environmental well-being.The  croaks purrs and grunts  of a thriving coral reef and the  underground rave concert of bubbles and clicks  of healthy soil have both been recorded by scientists to boost ecosystem health.Now in a new piece premiering at the Durham Book Festival in England the  cavernous  effects of a coal mine and the  sound of carbon  are being presented alongside music played by colliery bands and interviews with former coal miners and their families.The recording was made in a Beamish Museum mine shaft. It involved projecting various sound waves into the cave-like space and recording the reverberations. Plans are in the works for an exhibition of the project and a vinyl record release embedded with coal dust.

Volvo Cars has scrapped its goal of selling only electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030 as demand for battery-powered vehicles falls.The Swedish carmaker said it is now aiming for  90 to 100 per cent of its global sales volume by 2030 to consist of electrified cars  including a combination of EVs and plug-in hybrids.Volvo blamed shifting market conditions for changing a target it announced just three years earlier.The industry has been facing a slowdown and uncertainty caused by trade tariffs imposed on EVs manufactured in China.Ford and General Motors have also scaled back their EV plans.Volvo said it may also offer a limited number of  mild hybrids    more conventional cars that have limited electrical assistance. The automaker said factors like delayed charging infrastructure rollout and the removal of consumer incentives had changed the EV business climate.Volvo expects a combination of full EVs and hybrids to make up from 50 to 60 percent of its sales by 2025. An earlier target of the company was for a minimum of half of their vehicles to be fully electric by next year with the remainder being made up of hybrid models.
