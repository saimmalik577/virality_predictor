We re taking the Trump administration to court to protect our oceans from dirty offshore drilling! Oceana and our allies are suing the Trump administration challenging an order that revokes ocean protections and opens vast areas to offshore drilling. The lawsuit seeks to reinstate safeguards for millions of acres of ocean along the Atlantic Pacific Gulf and Alaska coasts emphasizing the need to protect ocean wildlife marine habitat and coastal communities This legal action marks a significant stand against policies that prioritize fossil fuel expansion over environmental conservation. President Trump does not have the authority to destroy our oceans in this way and Oceana is fighting to ensure he does not. Read more with our full press release.

You OTTER believe it - #SeaOtterAwarenessWeek is here!  Unlike many marine mammals the sea otter doesnt have blubber to keep warm. Instead it has super super thick fur - some of the densest in the whole animal kingdom! The sea otters coat has two layers which traps air against the otters skin keeping it warm dry and buoyant. But this fur can also pose major challenges for sea otters. These mammals were nearly hunted to extinction for their pelts until the turn of the 20th century. And while their populations have seen some recovery sea otters still face serious threats including oil pollution and habitat loss. Stand up for sea otters with a symbolic adoption today!

Some bright comb jellies to add more light to your holidays.   Wondering how comb jellies produce such a beautiful display? Well these colorful animals possess specialized cells that produce photoproteins which generate the bioluminescent displays seen in some jellyfish.Although typically transparent many comb jellies give off blue and green bioluminescence. But unlike true jellyfish species comb jellies also shine without it! They do this with their cilia hair-like projections referred to as  combs  which is where comb jellyfish got its name. When light reflects off these combs it creates rainbow displays that can be seen in the ocean at night.    : Shutterstock,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/12/oceana_17865145914282039.jpeg,0.23079,2024-12-24 16:55:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_oceana_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_f49c_CLEANED_24.jpeg

This #InternationalPolarBearDay we re celebrating one of the Arctic s most iconic animals!   Polar bears are perfectly suited for life on ice. They sport large padded claws and webbed toes which give them the ability to walk across the ice and swim as needed. They are specially evolved for the cold with black skin underneath their dense translucent fur coat that absorbs sunlight and keeps the bears warm! But being so well-adapted for the cold means they face a major threat: climate change. Warming temperatures cause more ice to melt earlier in the year making hunting increasingly difficult which causes bears to starve. The climate crisis is something we know how to combat and our oceans can be a key player in this battle.

Happy #WorldLizardDay from one very special reptile: the marine iguana!  Found in the Galapagos Islands the marine iguana is the only lizard that spends significant amounts of time at sea. These unique lizards can dive to depths of around 30 feet where they graze on algae sea grass and other marine plants that grow on the ocean floor. But the ocean water they swim in is cold- a problem for reptiles like these that can t internally regulate their body temperature. So after a swim marine iguanas need to bask in the sun to warm back up! Learn more about marine iguanas with our Marine Life Encyclopedia.

The trumpetfish is certainly an unusual-looking fish! West Atlantic trumpetfish live near coral reefs where they feed mostly on other fish species. To hunt they are known to float vertically with their head down near elongated objects like long sponges or ropes for camouflage. Then they dart down to attack when they spot their prey! Trumpetfish are also known to camouflage by swimming next to large herbivorous fish in order to approach their prey without being seen.

Northern Peru has seen its fair share of hardships lately. On December 21 a large oil spill occurred by the port of Talara contaminating the surrounding area. The party responsible was identified as Petroperu. As they did not issue an alarm or immediate & appropriate contingency measures the oil consequently impacted an estimated 10000 square meters of sea. While the situation is now contained Petroperu has not been transparent about the amount of oil spilled. The spill has been devastating for marine life as well as those who depend on the ocean for their livelihood like artisanal fishers and tour operators.  Just a week later northern Peru also saw the arrival of abnormal strong waves creating devastating flooding and further impacting local fishers in this area. The impact of these events has affected thousands of people and their livelihoods. Oceana_Peru is calling for action to be taken to hold Petroperu accountable for the damage the oil spill has done. We also continue our work to support local artisanal fishers and coastal communities who depend on our oceans to survive.,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/01/oceana_17891497164117318.jpeg,0.15931,2025-01-10 21:07:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_oceana_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_f49c_CLEANED_45.jpeg
Fewer than 100 Rice s whales remain making them one of the rarest whales on Earth. But instead of protecting them President Trump is prioritizing offshore drilling in their only home the Gulf of Mexico. An Executive Order signed in February removes a requirement for oil and gas company ships to avoid or travel slowly in areas where Rice s whales may be present. These extra precautions decrease the risk of extinction for these extremely rare whales that are already threatened by oil spills vessel strikes and noise pollution. These incredible whales deserve to be protected. We can t let dirty & dangerous offshore drilling come before the future of an entire species!

Illegal wildlife trade threatens thousands of species including mammals birds fish and even plants. Oceana campaigns to protect ocean species from illegal trafficking by working with local communities governments and other allies   and together we re making change.  In 2022 following campaigning by Oceana and others Peru became the first South American country to declare illegal wildlife trafficking as a form of organized crime giving Peruvian authorities more legal tools to enforce the law and penalize those operating criminal networks.Later that year after more than a decade of campaigning by Oceana and our allies the United States Congress passed a law to ban the buying and selling of shark fins officially removing the U.S. from the unsustainable global shark fin trade where fins from as many as 73 million sharks end up each year. Oceana continues partnering with communities to protect marine species around the world and ensure the health and sustainability of our oceans for future generations. #StandForOceans,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/04/oceana_18008879219178989.jpeg,0.15341,2024-04-29 00:50:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_oceana_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_f49c_CLEANED_47.jpeg

#BREAKING: Today new estimates put the North Atlantic right whale population at around 372 individuals which means they are still at risk of extinction. These critically endangered whales need better protection from their top threats: boat strikes and entanglement in fishing gear. In just 2024 alone at least four right whales were killed by boat strikes and entanglement in fishing gear and four additional calves are missing and presumed dead. Each one of these deaths is a major blow to the population s ability to recover. The U.S. government MUST do more to protect these whales especially vulnerable calves and new mothers. POTUS needs to finalize the updated Vessel Speed Rule immediately. By failing to take action our leaders risk letting these iconic whales disappear   forever.Read our full statement with the #linkinbio. #RightWhaleToSave,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/10/oceana_17903965412964929.jpeg,0.15055,2024-10-22 20:21:00,IMAGE,Posts_oceana_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_f49c_CLEANED_51.jpeg

A juvenile humpback whale that has been entangled in fishing gear for months is finally free! The whale was first seen earlier this month with rope from fishing gear wrapped around its tail. Given the state of its health and injuries it s estimated that it may have been entangled for as long as six months. Fortunately a team from NOAA was able to find the whale and cut the rope freeing it from its entanglement. However even with the gear off scientists fear it may not survive the injuries it sustained. Entanglement in fishing gear is a top threat to endangered animals off the West Coast including humpback whales. Sadly 75% of reported whale entanglements are fatal as whales can drag heavy fishing gear for months hindering their ability to dive and feed and leading to starvation and infection. We hope this whale is one of the fortunate individuals to survive an entanglement. Whales deserve to have safe passage as they migrate and feed off our shores! Oceana campaigns for stronger protections for whales to reduce wildlife entanglements like this one and is pushing for  whale-safe  ropeless gear that is a viable way to keep fishermen on the water and is safer for whales and sea turtles.   : NOAA,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/07/oceana_18056821582724200.jpeg,0.14808,2024-07-25 00:43:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_oceana_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_f49c_CLEANED_53.jpeg

While most coral species are immobile some can WALK. Marine biologists at Queensland University of Technology in Australia filmed little tiny 1-inch-long disc corals walking. They found that these little coral move like jellyfish   by twisting and contracting their muscles to inflate themselves before all of a sudden throwing themselves forward with the pressure of deflating. And how quickly are these things chugging along?? Well  not very. Dr. Lewis measured a whopping 8 inches covered by one of his corals in a whole day. They move because their current habitat is overcrowded full of waves that topple them over or not close to other corals to reproduce with!  : Lewis BM Suggett DJ Prentis PJ Nothdurft LD (2025) Walking coral: Complex phototactic mobility in the free-living coral Cycloseris cyclolites.

Protecting Patagonias Hidden Gem   Katalalixar   a far-flung maze of islands and fjords to the west of the Patagonian ice fields   is the ancestral homeland of the Kaw sqar people. Beneath its glacier-chilled surface is an underwater wonderland teeming with life.   Now we face the challenge of protecting this part of Patagonia and safeguarding Katalalixar from industrial threats. To do so we funded a story-gathering project with Kaw sqar residents in the town of Puerto Eden to document and map out their traditional knowledge of the local land and sea. The work then inspired a  cultural  expedition which paired Oceana staff with a five-member Kaw sqar family on a 15-day journey. The journey was far from easy   storms food shortages and treacherous seas tested our resilience. But it was all worth it to work towards our goal of persuading the government to bolster protections for this ecologically and culturally important region by designating it as a national park.   The expeditions footage was turned into a documentary film that premiered in January 2023 in order to shine a spotlight on the issue and generate support to  protect the marine ecosystem. We are proud to support the Kaw sqar residing in Puerto Eden in protecting their local land and sea!

Happy #WorldMantaDay!  Oceanic manta rays can grow to astonishing widths of over 25 feet and can weigh up to 3000 pounds! They grow so big by filter feeding on massive amounts of tiny plankton as well as schools of small fish.     The manta ray uses the appendages on each side of its mouth called cephalic lobes to guide its meal into its maw. Learn more about these ocean giants with our Marine Life Encyclopedia!

The largest of the world s sea turtles leatherbacks have existed essentially unchanged since prehistoric times. But today despite being protected under the Endangered Species Act leatherback sea turtles are among the most endangered animals in the ocean specifically the Pacific population.These turtles face being caught accidentally in fishing gear as well as being targeted for their meat and eggs. Thankfully since these threats have been identified work is being done to address them! Oceana has successfully campaigned to protect leatherbacks and their habitat gaining them increased habitat protections under California s Endangered Species Act. We have also helped introduce regulations to transition various local fisheries away from gear prone to entangling marine life like drift gillnets and long line crab pots.We continue fighting to protect these titanic turtles and other threatened wildlife in our seas! #LeatherbackDay #SeaTurtleWeek,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/blank.jpg,0.13217,2024-06-15 19:16:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_oceana_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_f49c_CLEANED_71.jpeg

Right now the world is going through a MASSIVE coral bleaching event. The impacts of climate change on our oceans   and our entire planet   cannot be ignored. To combat this climate crisis we must drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and our oceans can play a key role in the battle. Countries like the United States must stop the expansion of dirty and dangerous offshore drilling and move towards clean energy to turn the tide before it s too late.,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/04/oceana_18004486721595741.jpeg,0.12654,2024-04-25 00:36:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_oceana_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_f49c_CLEANED_74.jpeg

Pacific leatherback sea turtles roamed the earth with dinosaurs surviving for 100 million years virtually unchanged. But today they are the most endangered sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean with their population having declined 95% over the last 30 years. Back in February the California Ocean Protection Council authorized new funding for the state to help prevent whales and sea turtles like Pacific leatherbacks from becoming entangled in fishing gear following campaigning by Oceana and its allies. This included up to $650000 to advance innovative  ropeless fishing gear  in the state s commercial Dungeness crab fishery. Ropeless gear allows for fishers to both catch crab more often and do so with far less risk to ocean wildlife. This decision by California supports fishing practices that ensure whales and sea turtles can safely feed and migrate off the California coast. Oceana continues to campaign to protect Pacific leatherbacks whales and other ocean life from entanglement in fishing gear and other threats. #PacificLeatherbackConservationDay  : Doug Perrine / Alamy  #LeatherbackTurtle #PacificLeatherback #SeaTurtle #MarineAnimal #Ocean,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/10/oceana_18020038424291911.jpeg,0.1258,2024-10-15 21:35:00,IMAGE,Posts_oceana_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_f49c_CLEANED_76.jpeg

HEARTBREAKING: In the past few weeks two humpback whales have been seen off the U.S. West Coast suffering devastating injuries from entanglements in fishing gear. One which was seen with rope wrapped around its tail thankfully has been disentangled although concerns still linger about its health. But the other is not so lucky   missing its entire tail the whale is critically wounded and unlikely to survive as it struggles to dive and feed. Entanglement in fishing gear is a top threat to whales and sea turtles. Once a whale is trapped in fishing gear it can drag the heavy  ropes and traps for weeks if not months before falling victim to its wounds. Fishery managers must do more to protect these majestic animals! Call for more to be done to protect whales from deadly entanglements today with the #linkinbio.  : NOAA : The Whale Museum.

THEN AND NOW: Back in 2017 little was known of Chile s Pisagua Bay seabed until Oceana and the uarturoprat decided to investigate. On our first expedition we were amazed by what we found. This vibrant area is home to coral banks manta rays Chilean jack mackerel and so much more. We knew right away: this place had to be protected   so we took action! Fast forward to 2023 our vision is finally a reality! Following three more expeditions and a scientific recommendation of protection Chile has officially established the Pisagua Sea Marine Protected Area (MPA). Spanning over 181500 acres this MPA safeguards not just marine habitats and species but also the livelihoods of local artisanal fishers who depend on these waters. Oceana worked closely with Pisagua s artisanal fishers to ensure the MPA s creation supports the ocean and their economy.  Pisagua Sea  is now the first MPA in Chile designed to both protect marine life and the people who rely on it.

New research highlights that Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) which were initially designed to safeguard marine life could also be a vital tool in addressing climate change.Research around natural carbon storage that happens in the ocean often referred to as  blue carbon  has typically focused on mangrove forests salt marshes and seagrass meadows. But this study argues that seabed sediments may hold greater potential for carbon storage and should also be considered for protection.See how Oceana is campaigning to protect ocean habitat and protect our climate with the #linkinbio.,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/02/oceana_18038424605454251.jpeg,0.1016,2025-02-25 16:53:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_oceana_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_f49c_CLEANED_109.jpeg

Not all hermit crabs use shells as their home! Most species rely on borrowed shells to protect their soft abdomens but deepwater hermit crabs (family Parapaguridae) take a unique approach.   These crabs team up with sea anemones (family Hormathiidae) in an incredible partnership. Initially the crab inhabits a shell but over time the anemone overgrows and dissolves the shell forming a flexible covering that grows with the crab! This mutualistic relationship benefits both: the crab gets protection from predators like octopuses thanks to the anemones stinging tentacles while the anemone enjoys a free ride across the seafloor.  : Image courtesy of the NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research 2015 Hohonu Moana.,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/01/oceana_18254832697263363.jpeg,0.09889,2025-01-23 02:41:00,IMAGE,Posts_oceana_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_f49c_CLEANED_114.jpeg

A new study has found that some large fishes use sharks to remove parasites. Research revealed that large open-ocean fish like tuna sometimes scrape against sharks to get rid of parasites and seem to prefer scraping against them even than other fish of the same species.These findings reveal new ways that species can be connected beneath the waves   which is both fascinating and highlights threats to ocean wildlife. Global shark populations are declining which the authors suggest may eventually lead to these fish having a harder time ridding themselves of parasites and threatening their overall health. Our oceans are an interconnected web of biodiversity. When one species declines many others can suffer as well. We must safeguard vulnerable marine species and promote biodiversity so that all ocean wildlife can thrive.,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/11/oceana_18023888099265761.jpeg,0.08702,2024-11-14 02:57:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_oceana_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_f49c_CLEANED_135.jpeg

NEWS FROM CALIFORNIA: The largest and most successful trial of pop-up fishing gear ever conducted on U.S. West Coast proves profitable for fishermen and safe for whales!   The California Dungeness crab fishery and whales are both in a state of crisis due to wildlife entanglements in fishing gear. Pop-up fishing gear is a gateway to keeping fishermen on the water in the spring when waters are closed to conventional crabbing gear.   The gear which was tested by 19 commercial California Dungeness crab fishermen brought in $1.6M of crab in spring 2024 during a time when fishers otherwise would not have been able to operate due to the risk of entangling endangered whales. These results prove this gear is successful profitable enforceable whale-safe and ready to restore a vibrant spring crab fishery!

Your reminder of the day: Healthy oceans need sharks.Sharks play a very important role in keeping ocean ecosystems in balance. They keep prey populations in check and feed on old and sick fish helping to keep the overall population healthier. Oceana campaigns to end the trade for shark fins   which incentivizes overfishing and shark finning   as well as trade shark meat and other products that persists around the world. Saving sharks requires global protections and dedicated enforcement of them as well as an end to the devastating global shark fin trade.,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/04/oceana_18064496236995218.jpeg,0.08009,2025-04-14 16:50:00,reel,Posts_oceana_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_f49c_CLEANED_150.jpeg

HEARTBREAKING: Two North Atlantic right whales have been seen entangled in fishing gear off the coast of Massachusetts. One of these whales a juvenile male known as #5110 has a thick line wrapped around his head and back likely making it extremely difficult for him to feed. Sadly experts believe he is unlikely to survive this entanglement. The other whale an adult female known as #4120 was also seen with fishing lines wrapped around her mouth. Fortunately her injuries appear to be less severe and experts are optimistic she may be able to survive this entanglement. Scientists are monitoring these whales with the hope of mounting a response but dangerous disentanglement efforts depend on a lot of external factors like knowing the whales location weather and are not always possible or successful. These whales are not statistics they are living beings enduring unimaginable suffering caused by human activities  said Oceana s Gib Brogan.  NOAA is long overdue for establishing effective safeguards for North Atlantic right whales.

Against all odds another North Atlantic right whale just pulled off a legendary move: having a calf!     At 18 years old  Check Mark  has given birth to her first calf. With around 370 individuals remaining and only 70 breeding females this baby is living proof that survival is the ultimate flex for these gentle giants. Mom Check Mark is especially impressive as she lost part of her right fluke earlier in life due to a vessel strike. To keep up the good fight this mother and calf will have to make it back up north avoiding speeding ships and fishing lines. Let s give these legends the protection they deserve.

Exciting News!   We re thrilled to announce starboroughwine is returning as an Oceana partner in 2025. Over the last five years Starborough s support has helped Oceana achieve major milestones in ocean conservation with a combined donation of over $250000. Here s a look at some of what we ve accomplished together:   Mexico created the Southern Gulf of Mexico Reefs National Park the largest marine protected area in the Gulf of Mexico. This declaration follows multiple Oceana expeditions to the area.   Following campaigning by Oceana and allies Chile s congress passed the Benthic Law which will improve the management of kelp   a key ecosystem for marine life and an important resource for artisanal fishers.   In 2020 following more than a decade of campaigning by Oceana and our allies Spain s Supreme Court upheld the expansion of Cabrera Marine National Park Making it the second-largest marine protected area in the Mediterranean and the first to protect deep-sea corals.

#Paris2024 may be serving beverages in reusable cups but they re not winning any gold medals for the environment. At the 2024 Olympic games beverages are being sold to spectators in reusable packaging which could potentially replace millions of single-use plastic cups. But while leading sponsor theCocaColaCo touts its success at reducing plastic the reality is far from perfect. Many of these drinks are being poured into reusable cups from single use plastic bottles defeating the purpose of reuse in reducing plastic waste.  From a top global plastic polluter and major sports sponsor like theCocaColaCo much more is needed to address the plastic crisis. Despite the flaws the inclusion of reuse at Paris 2024 remains a beacon of hope for the oceans. Reuse done right CAN have a major impact on the environment and there is a growing trend for large events like this to use reusable packaging. Oceana is pushing for reuse to be done more and to be done better. Plastic pollution is an issue that impacts us all   athletes and spectators alike   and it s time for us to come together and ditch single-use plastic in favor of reuse.

It has now been 14 years since all forms of bottom trawling were prohibited in Belize s waters!   Bottom trawling is a highly destructive fishing practice where huge nets are dragged for miles along the seafloor bulldozing everything in their path. In December 2010 the Belize government banned trawling in the country s waters to protect its marine ecosystems and wildlife. Oceana_bze collaborated with the Prime Minister s administration at the time to help make this ban possible. This milestone stands as a testament to Belize s commitment to protecting marine ecosystems. However bottom trawling continues to threaten oceans globally.

#UPDATE: An oil tanker holding 1.4 million liters of oil sank in the Philippines Manila Bay on July 25 due to heavy rains and rough waters from Typhoon Gaemi. At least two other vessels have also sunk since then causing further oil pollution.It is estimated that the oil spill impacts 50% of Manila Bay with the oil pollution reaching Cavite Bulacan and Bataan. The spill can smother suffocate and kill important mangroves coral reefs and seagrass beds here which are essential for the breeding and feeding of numerous marine species in Manila Bay. We know what s at stake here: jobs food exports and even lives  said Oceana_phs Gloria Ramos.  Even after the oil pollution is cleaned up seafood may be contaminated for years. The people of the Philippines will be dealing with the impacts of this devastation long after the headlines fade and the government must do everything it can to mitigate this disaster as quickly as possible.

Armando Paiva grew up fishing in Piura Peru like his father and grandfather. Here the first five nautical miles off Perus coast are critical to vibrant local marine life and sustaining artisanal fishers like Armando who provide 80% of the nations seafood. But much can change in a generation. Industrial fishers operating with an unselective take-all approach can use gear that causes harm to ocean habitat fisheries abundance and artisanal fishers  livelihoods. Armando and other artisanal fishermen knew that Peru s coast needed protecting and that they needed to take action to make that happen.Now Armando is a board member of the El Toril Artisanal Fishermen s Union in Piura and his career involves not only fishing but advocating on behalf of artisanal fishers in his community and building alliances with others across the country.

Its clear: when we drill we spill.Offshore drilling is a dirty and dangerous business that puts fragile ecosystems marine wildlife and our coastlines at constant risk of catastrophic oil spills. And these spills come with significant long-term effects with oil being found in sediment decades later and animals experiencing extreme sickness and eventual death. Oceana campaigns to protect our coasts and oceans from the threat of offshore drilling while promoting clean energy methods like responsibly sourced offshore wind.  And alongside our allies we have protected about 75000 miles of coastline in the United States and Belize covering more than 2.5 million square miles of ocean! But there s still more work to be done.

Our trip to Campeche Bank in the Gulf of Mexico was truly stunning!  Our scientific expedition in partnership with CONANP helped us learn more about the status of the reefs in this area. Our preliminary results indicate healthy coral reefs off the coast of Campeche good news for the ecosystem!   Researchers on the expedition also found over 75 nesting areas for green turtles and hawksbill turtles as well as juvenile sea turtles indicating that this area is of high importance for these threatened animals.  This research will help us learn more about these coral reefs and provide a solid scientific basis for better protecting these sites that are home to such astounding biodiversity!

Recent studies have discovered a whole new way plastic is impacting seabirds. Plasticosis as its been named is scarring in the stomach caused by injuries from ingesting plastic. This scarring which was found in a study on shearwater fledglings makes it harder for the birds to digest their food weakening them and putting them at risk of illness and injury. Right now Plasticosis has only been seen in seabirds but we know that plastic is everywhere   including in the food that we ourselves are eating. Plastic is choking our oceans and polluting our planet and urgent action is needed to reduce single-use plastic at the source or else we re going to continue to feel the impact in novel and horrifying ways like Plasticosis.

It s #NationalStrawberryDay Did you know the ocean has its own version of wild strawberry fields? Meet the strawberry anemone! These tiny jewel-like anemones are rarely larger than the size of a nickel in diameter and often even smaller than a dime. Some live in clusters just below the tideline creating dazzling underwater colonies while others are solitary and show off their red luster in the shallow ocean depths. On our research expeditions we have encountered beautiful bunches of strawberry anemones particularly off California where they can completely cover rocks boulders and vertical rock walls. While their range extends as far as British Columbia a separate species of strawberry anemone in the Atlantic Ocean features a unique pattern that resembles strawberry seeds.,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/02/oceana_18135650095388522.jpeg,0.06583,2025-02-27 21:00:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_oceana_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_f49c_CLEANED_190.jpeg

North Atlantic right whales continue to be found entangled in Canadian waters. This summer three critically endangered whales have been spotted tangled in fishing gear along Canada s coast and only one has been successfully disentangled by responders. Each whale was dragging ropes in its mouth and some also had lines wrapped around their bodies and flippers. When whales get lines trapped in their mouth it can seriously impact their ability to feed and dive which can be life-threatening. North Atlantic right whales migrate from the warm waters off Florida and Georgia traveling along the East Coast of North America to feed in Canadian waters. Along their journey they face numerous threats including entanglement in fishing gear and the danger of being struck by speeding ships. With only around 356 of these whales left alive we are running out of time to pass essential protections to save the North Atlantic right whale from extinction.

#BREAKING: Another North Atlantic right whale has been seen entangled in fishing gear.  Shelagh was recently spotted with in Canada s Gulf of St. Lawrence with fishing gear stuck in her mouth. Researchers are determining if a disentanglement mission is possible but disentangling whales is dangerous work and can t fix the bigger issue: far too many North Atlantic right whales are getting caught up in fishing gear and dying.  Entanglements like this are one of the biggest threats to these critically endangered whales.

Watching a school of fish swim in perfect harmony is mesmerizing but have you ever wondered why they move so seamlessly together? 1  To avoid predators. Swimming in sync makes it harder for predators to focus on a single fish reducing the chances of an attack. By sticking together they create a confusing ever-shifting mass that keeps them safer. 2  To save energy.Much like migrating birds fish move in unison to travel more efficiently. When swimming together the hydrodynamics of the fish school can allow them to swim using less energy than if they were swimming on their own. 3  To feed.More eyes mean a better chance of spotting food! Schooling also allows fish to venture into areas they might avoid alone as there s safety in numbers.,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/blank.jpg,0.06121,2025-04-06 22:48:00,reel,Posts_oceana_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_f49c_CLEANED_206.jpeg

HEARTBREAKING: Recently a 10-day old northern royal albatross chick like this one died from eating plastic   that its parents unwittingly fed it.Unable to fly or find their own food young albatross chicks depend on mom and dad to head out to sea and bring back food. But more and more albatrosses are eating something else instead   plastic. And this can be deadly. Digesting sharp bits of plastic can cause internal cuts leading to bleeding and infection and it can also block the bird s digestive system leading to starvation. And it s going to keep happening to seabirds around the world if we keep flooding our oceans with unnecessary single-use plastic. Our plastic consumption has become a global crisis with wildlife like this baby albatross paying the price. Urgent action is needed to reduce single-use plastic at the source and protect our planet. Add your name to call for global leaders to #BreakFreeFromPlastic today with the #linkinbio.  : A northern royal albatross chick the same species of the chick that died from ingesting plastic earlier this year.

Why Lobster is Off the Menu in Brazil   If you found yourself on the beaches of Cear  Brazil you might be tempted to try one of the main delicacies of the Brazilian Northeast: lobster. But right now that s not an option. From November 1st to April 30th lobster fishing is strictly off-limits a crucial pause that allows populations to recover after years of overfishing. And as of February 1st even selling lobster in Brazil is illegal. Why? Because beneath the waves something crucial is happening: lobsters are reproducing.   Without this seasonal break the future of lobster (and the thousands of families who rely on it for their livelihood) would be in jeopardy. Oceana s 2019 stock assessment of red lobsters highlighted the urgency of this issue mobilizing artisanal fishers industry leaders and allies to support catch limits. Lobster is more than just a delicacy it s a lifeline for over 15000 families in Brazil.  The closed season is one of the main tools for ensuring the sustainability of the species  says artisanal fisherman Tobias Soares.  When we respect these rules we are defending the lobster and our livelihood.   : Oceana/Christian BragaOceanaBrasil,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2025/02/oceana_18292684414244598.jpeg,0.05514,2025-02-24 02:10:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_oceana_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_f49c_CLEANED_222.jpeg

Always at ease at sea Sidneia Lusia da Silva already knew at the age of 10 what her destiny would be: to be a fisherwoman!   Even as a child growing up among 13 brothers and sisters in the northeast coast of Brazil Sidneia never got seasick when she went fishing.  I wake up and look at the sea and the sea gives me a strength that I have never found anywhere else  she says.  Come rain or shine fishing is where I make my living and what makes me happy.  However lobster fishing Sidneia s main source of livelihood has faced challenges. A 2019 assessment by Oceana revealed that the red lobstery fishery was on the verge of collapse. Oceana s analysis and campaigning helped to mobilize artisanal fishers fishing industries and other allies to support implementing catch limits which would help recover the lobster populations and support local fishing communities. These science-based catch limits were implemented earlier this year for the 2024 season a major win for our oceans and for fishers like Sidneia!

European Union law requires countries to allocate fishing opportunities based on transparent and objective criteria taking into account the benefits for society the economy and the environment. However in practice most countries distribute fishing quotas primarily to those with a history of catching the most fish favoring industrial fleets over artisanal vessels. This approach harms both coastal fishing communities and the marine environment.oceanaeuropes photo exhibition showcasing low-impact fishers across Europe took place from 30 September to 4 October in front of the European Parliament in Brussels. It introduced David Muireann Neily and Primitivo   artisanal fishers dedicated to providing fresh high-quality seafood while preserving the sustainability and heritage of their coastal communities.Take a look at some of the stunning pictures featured as well as moments from the inauguration.

DID YOU KNOW: All the plastic products we use in our daily lives start as plastic pellets. An estimated 250000 tons of these pea-sized plastic pellets end up in the oceans every year! These pre-production pellets also called nurdles are frequently spilled during production and transportation and end up in our oceans and waterways. And once they re there they are very difficult to clean up due to their small size. The U.S. needs more tools to keep these plastic pellets from entering our oceans!

Over a third of the world s fish populations are depleted    but the impacts of overfishing arent spread evenly.In regions like West Africa and Southeast Asia where much of the population lives by the sea and relies on fishing for their livelihoods the challenges are greater. Its a tangled story of industrial fishing local livelihoods and climate change.  In Ghana small-scale fishing communities with deep connections to the sea struggle to catch the fish they need compared to industrial vessels.   In Senegal an overcrowded fishing industry combined with the impacts of climate change is both harming fish populations and sending ripples through local economies.   In Malaysia even in one of the countrys oldest fishing villages there are less fish to go around.Any efforts to recover fisheries must prioritize equity. Thats why Oceana is preparing to launch new campaigns to empower the people who rely the most on fish to develop solutions that work for them.

From the brink of extinction: The brown pelican s comeback Once nearly wiped out by the feather trade then poisoned by pesticides the brown pelican is the original success story of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). In the late 1800s these iconic coastal birds were hunted relentlessly for their feathers prized in high fashion. Then in the 1950s they faced a new threat: DDT. This toxic pesticide made its way up the food chain causing pelican eggshells to thin and break before chicks could hatch. Their numbers plummeted. Listed as endangered in 1970 under the Endangered Species Act the brown pelican s turning point came when DDT was banned in the United States in 1972 and with habitat protection thanks to the ESA. As DDT contamination levels dropped their populations rebounded. By 2009 they were fully removed from the Endangered Species List. Today brown pelicans soar along North America s coasts a powerful reminder that the Endangered Species Act works. But now following proposed cuts to NOAA s ability to defend threatened wildlife this critical law is also under attack.   Join us in defending the Endangered Species Act because every species deserves the same chance at survival that the brown pelican had!

Recycling alone cannot solve the ocean plastic pollution crisis.A meager 9% of all plastic waste generated has been recycled. We know that we can t recycle our way out of this mess especially as plastic production is expected to triple by 2050.That s why Oceana is campaigning to stop plastic pollution at the source   by passing local state and national policies that reduce the production and use of unnecessary single-use plastic that is flowing into our oceans while also working with companies to move to refillable and reusable systems.If plastics are significantly reduced at the source less plastic waste will enter the oceans where it poses a grave threat to marine life.

A Legacy of Courage and Community Jos  Alberto Lima Ribeiro known as Beto Pescador comes from a generation of traditional fishermen from Praia do Canto Verde on the eastern coast of Brazil. His journey into artisanal fishing began at the age of 8 inspired by stories from seasoned fishermen. Among them the tale of the Jangada de S o Pedro a daring voyage in 1941 to demand labor rights from the President of Brazil ignited his lifelong passion for advocacy. Now Beto is at the forefront of modern struggles fighting for fair fishing policies and the preservation of traditional fishing communities. Among what he works towards is a new Fishing Law that will benefit both small-scale fishers and our oceans. With support from OceanaBrasil a bill that would modernize the current Fishing Law was just filed in Brazil s Senate. This bill was drafted with input fishers and shellfish gatherers from traditional communities and is a promising step forward for responsibly managed fisheries and the health of our oceans!  We need to put forward our point of view on sustainability and environmental preservation in order to improve fishing in general says Beto. Only if we are organized will we be able to be heard and have the space we deserve.  Read more with the #linkinbio.  : Beto Pescado. Credit: Oceana/Andressa Anholete : Beach in Cear  Brazil.

Did you know that in Spain more than half of the marine protected areas are not properly protected? This is because bottom trawling and other forms of destructive fishing are allowed inside these biodiversity hotspots. This has to stop! It is urgent to shield these unique places and safeguard the species that inhabit them. This is the only way to guarantee the conservation and restoration of these habitats. #oceana #oceanaeurope #oceanprotection #oceanconservation #marineconservation #bottomtrawling #bottomfishing #trawler #trawling #ocean #sea #marineprotectedarea #marineprotectedareas #natura2000 #paperparks,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/04/oceana_18027840875002700.jpeg,0.03544,2024-04-24 18:09:00,reel,Posts_oceana_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_f49c_CLEANED_326.jpeg

Every day over 200 tons of unnecessary plastic are generated from e-commerce in Mexico City.  Earlier this month Oceana  Avaaz and UNAM students delivered 30000 citizen signatures calling for the Congress of Mexico City to approve a bill that would reduce the single-use plastic that comes from e-commerce. This bill would make a big impact protecting marine life and our oceans from plastic pollution but right now it s stuck in the Legislative Branch awaiting approval. Every minute of delay is more unnecessary plastic waste! It s time for Mexico City to approve this vital bill and act for plastic-free shipping. #Env osSinPl sticos OceanaMexico,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/05/oceana_17913344213948026.jpeg,0.03483,2024-05-27 21:09:00,CAROUSEL_ALBUM,Posts_oceana_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_f49c_CLEANED_331.jpeg

Victory for Brazil with new lobsters catch limits implemented!   Since the 1950 s red spiny lobster and green lobster populations in Brazil have been in steep decline. The potential collapse of this fishery would not only impact these marine species and our oceans but also local artisanal fishers who depend on this activity for their food and livelihood.  For years fishers scientific community industry stakeholders and nonprofit organizations like Oceanabrasil have been working together to try and address this issue. Now through scientific studies stock assessments and coordination with fisherfolk we have helped convince the government to finally act towards a sustainable lobster fishery!  Tobias da Silva a local lobster fisherman emphasizes the importance of adhering to the newly established regulations: Now what needs to be done is to respect the rules. It needs to start with us fisherfolks this respect. And the government needs to do its part. If everyone does their part we ensure that the lobster species do not come to an end.,https://imgs.socialinsider.io/instagram/2024/05/oceana_17978288750693952.jpeg,0.03436,2024-05-27 00:35:00,reel,Posts_oceana_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_f49c_CLEANED_333.jpeg

After a 32-year moratorium the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has announced the reopening of the commercial northern cod fishery along with increasing the Canadian fishing quota by 38.5%.The decision made as the stock barely moved out of the critical zone poses significant risks to the future recovery of this iconic fish population and a centuries-old fishery that is vital for Newfoundland and Labrador ocean ecosystems and coastal communities. It ignores scientific advice and the urgent need to address the impacts of decades of overfishing and short-sighted fisheries management. We are deeply concerned with this short-sighted decision as opening the commercial fishery puts the stock at significant risk and undermines efforts to rebuild healthy oceans and coastal communities.

VICTORY: New England cod nursery protected from proposed scallop dredging! Weve won protection for an important cod nursery on Georges Bank in New England. With our allies Oceana beat back an attempt by the U.S. scallop fishery to open this protected area to the dragging of heavy dredges along the seafloor to catch scallops which would damage habitat and scoop up other non-target marine life. Oceana persuaded the New England Fishery Management Council that this type of fishing is in direct conflict with preserving the area for spawning growth and feeding of Atlantic cod American lobster and Atlantic herring.

IMAGINE THIS: If single-use plastics had been around during these times they could STILL be around today. Mass production of plastics began to rise in the 1950 s so it s true that they weren t hanging around at events like the signing of the Declaration of Independence. However scientists believe that these plastics may take centuries to fully degrade so if they HAD been there these same plastics could still be around today. And yet some of these plastics are only actually in use for a few minutes before they are discarded. It s clear: the concept of single-use plastics doesn t make sense!

Have you been told that a disposable item is better because its made of cardboard or poly-paper?Many times cups and wrappers are made of poly-paper which makes them seem more environmentally friendly. However these products are still single-use plastics as they contain a plastic layer that makes them waterproof.Chiles Single-use Plastics Law aims to address this issue. Starting in 2026 reusable items will be required for on-site consumption in food establishments reducing the distribution of disposables that often end up as waste in cities and oceans.oceana_chile is part of a coalition with a variety of allies working to promote the Single-Use Plastics Law and support its implementation.

#BREAKING: A newborn North Atlantic right whale has been spotted with its mother #2430  Minus One  off Amelia Island in Florida! This is Minus One s fourth known calf and the two will stay in the waters of the Southeastern United States for several months while the calf grows and learns from mom.   Over 20 years ago Minus One was fortunate to survive a vessel strike which left her with lacerations along her right side. But although she was lucky then theres no guarantee that her luck will continue for her & her new calf. Far too many North Atlantic right whales are injured or killed by speeding boats and new mother-calf pairs are especially vulnerable.

For centuries many coastal Indigenous communities around the world have depended on wild fish for their livelihoods and as a critical source of nutritious food. And today Indigenous ways of knowing are vital to support sustainable fisheries and mitigation of climate change. To truly benefit our oceans and all those that depend on them we must meaningfully engage with Indigenous communities and organizations and mobilize Indigenous Knowledge Systems into conservation decision-making. Oceana continues to work with and learn from Indigenous communities to protect coastal waters restore abundant oceans and ensure the long-term health of coastal communities. #IndigenousDay #IDWIP2024  : Ocean research conducted in 2018 on the Central Coast of British Columbia where Oceana Canada partnered with Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) Heiltsuk and Kitasoo/Xai Xais Nations Central Coast Indigenous Resource Alliance and Ocean Networks Canada.  : Oceana_Canada work in partnership with Heiltsuk and Kitasoo/Xai Xais First Nations: Vernon and Brock fishing Doug on a Guardian Watchman boat.

BIG WIN FOR OUR OCEANS!   Last week the UK s North Sea saw a major win for marine life!  On January 30 a judge ruled that the approval of the Rosebank and Jackdaw oil and gas fields was unlawful  stopping these disastrous projects in their tracks. With marine heat waves overfishing and pollution already wreaking havoc on UK seas adding a major oil spill from Rosebank to the mix could have been catastrophic threatening 16 marine protected areas and wildlife from seabirds to seals. This ruling is a historic step toward clean energy and healthier oceans. But the fight isn t over.

A new Oceana analysis shows nearly 3000 fishing vessels spent months   and sometimes years   at sea without coming to port last year. These long voyages can be a risk indicator of illegal fishing activity or forced labor.

In 2021 Chile passed a law law regulating the distribution of single-use and disposable plastics in food establishments which came into play progressively. A central piece of this regulation was set to take effect on August 13 2024 and included among others the prohibition of distribution of any type of disposables for consumption within food establishments including food courts. However earlier in August Congress and the Government agreed to postpone the law by 18 months. However there still are already obligations in effect in Chile!For over a year food vendors have been prohibited from providing Styrofoam plastic cutlery straws or stirrers.
