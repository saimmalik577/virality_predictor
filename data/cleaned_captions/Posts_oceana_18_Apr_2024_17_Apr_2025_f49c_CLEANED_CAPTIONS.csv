They are specially evolved for the cold with black skin underneath their dense translucent fur coat that absorbs sunlight and keeps the bears warm! But being so well-adapted for the cold means they face a major threat: climate change. Warming temperatures cause more ice to melt earlier in the year making hunting increasingly difficult which causes bears to starve.

On December 21 a large oil spill occurred by the port of Talara contaminating the surrounding area. The party responsible was identified as Petroperu. As they did not issue an alarm or immediate & appropriate contingency measures the oil consequently impacted an estimated 10000 square meters of sea. While the situation is now contained Petroperu has not been transparent about the amount of oil spilled. The spill has been devastating for marine life as well as those who depend on the ocean for their livelihood like artisanal fishers and tour operators.

The whale was first seen earlier this month with rope from fishing gear wrapped around its tail. Given the state of its health and injuries it s estimated that it may have been entangled for as long as six months. Fortunately a team from NOAA was able to find the whale and cut the rope freeing it from its entanglement. However even with the gear off scientists fear it may not survive the injuries it sustained. Entanglement in fishing gear is a top threat to endangered animals off the West Coast including humpback whales. Sadly 75% of reported whale entanglements are fatal as whales can drag heavy fishing gear for months hindering their ability to dive and feed and leading to starvation and infection. We hope this whale is one of the fortunate individuals to survive an entanglement. Whales deserve to have safe passage as they migrate and feed off our shores!

Beneath its glacier-chilled surface is an underwater wonderland teeming with life.   Now we face the challenge of protecting this part of Patagonia and safeguarding Katalalixar from industrial threats. To do so we funded a story-gathering project with Kaw sqar residents in the town of Puerto Eden to document and map out their traditional knowledge of the local land and sea. The work then inspired a  cultural  expedition which paired Oceana staff with a five-member Kaw sqar family on a 15-day journey. The journey was far from easy   storms food shortages and treacherous seas tested our resilience. But it was all worth it to work towards our goal of persuading the government to bolster protections for this ecologically and culturally important region by designating it as a national park.   The expeditions footage was turned into a documentary film that premiered in January 2023 in order to shine a spotlight on the issue and generate support to  protect the marine ecosystem.

Posts_oceana_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_f49c_CLEANED_76.jpeg,Pacific leatherback sea turtles roamed the earth with dinosaurs surviving for 100 million years virtually unchanged. But today they are the most endangered sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean with their population having declined 95% over the last 30 years. Back in February the California Ocean Protection Council authorized new funding for the state to help prevent whales and sea turtles like Pacific leatherbacks from becoming entangled in fishing gear following campaigning by Oceana and its allies. This included up to $650000 to advance innovative  ropeless fishing gear  in the state s commercial Dungeness crab fishery. Ropeless gear allows for fishers to both catch crab more often and do so with far less risk to ocean wildlife. This decision by California supports fishing practices that ensure whales and sea turtles can safely feed and migrate off the California coast.

Posts_oceana_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_f49c_CLEANED_97.jpeg,THEN AND NOW: Back in 2017 little was known of Chile s Pisagua Bay seabed until Oceana and the uarturoprat decided to investigate. On our first expedition we were amazed by what we found. This vibrant area is home to coral banks manta rays Chilean jack mackerel and so much more. We knew right away: this place had to be protected   so we took action! Fast forward to 2023 our vision is finally a reality! Following three more expeditions and a scientific recommendation of protection Chile has officially established the Pisagua Sea Marine Protected Area (MPA). Spanning over 181500 acres this MPA safeguards not just marine habitats and species but also the livelihoods of local artisanal fishers who depend on these waters.

Most species rely on borrowed shells to protect their soft abdomens but deepwater hermit crabs (family Parapaguridae) take a unique approach.   These crabs team up with sea anemones (family Hormathiidae) in an incredible partnership. Initially the crab inhabits a shell but over time the anemone overgrows and dissolves the shell forming a flexible covering that grows with the crab! This mutualistic relationship benefits both: the crab gets protection from predators like octopuses thanks to the anemones stinging tentacles while the anemone enjoys a free ride across the seafloor.  : Image courtesy of the NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research 2015 Hohonu Moana.,not all hermit crabs use shells as their home most species rely on borrowed shells to protect their soft abdomens but deepwater hermit crabs family parapaguridae take a unique approach these crabs team up with sea anemones family hormathiidae in an incredible partnership initially the crab inhabits a shell but over time the anemone overgrows and dissolves the shell forming a flexible covering that grows with the crab this mutualistic relationship benefits both the crab gets protection from predators like octopuses thanks to the anemones stinging tentacles while the anemone enjoys a free ride across the seafloor image courtesy of the noaa office of ocean exploration and research 2015 hohonu moana

Research revealed that large open-ocean fish like tuna sometimes scrape against sharks to get rid of parasites and seem to prefer scraping against them even than other fish of the same species.These findings reveal new ways that species can be connected beneath the waves   which is both fascinating and highlights threats to ocean wildlife. Global shark populations are declining which the authors suggest may eventually lead to these fish having a harder time ridding themselves of parasites and threatening their overall health. Our oceans are an interconnected web of biodiversity. When one species declines many others can suffer as well. We must safeguard vulnerable marine species and promote biodiversity so that all ocean wildlife can thrive.,a new study has found that some large fishes use sharks to remove parasites research revealed that large openocean fish like tuna sometimes scrape against sharks to get rid of parasites and seem to prefer scraping against them even than other fish of the same speciesthese findings reveal new ways that species can be connected beneath the waves which is both fascinating and highlights threats to ocean wildlife global shark populations are declining which the authors suggest may eventually lead to these fish having a harder time ridding themselves of parasites and threatening their overall health our oceans are an interconnected web of biodiversity when one species declines many others can suffer as well we must safeguard vulnerable marine species and promote biodiversity so that all ocean wildlife can thrive

One of these whales a juvenile male known as #5110 has a thick line wrapped around his head and back likely making it extremely difficult for him to feed. Sadly experts believe he is unlikely to survive this entanglement. The other whale an adult female known as #4120 was also seen with fishing lines wrapped around her mouth. Fortunately her injuries appear to be less severe and experts are optimistic she may be able to survive this entanglement. Scientists are monitoring these whales with the hope of mounting a response but dangerous disentanglement efforts depend on a lot of external factors like knowing the whales location weather and are not always possible or successful. These whales are not statistics they are living beings enduring unimaginable suffering caused by human activities  said Oceana s Gib Brogan.

At the 2024 Olympic games beverages are being sold to spectators in reusable packaging which could potentially replace millions of single-use plastic cups. But while leading sponsor theCocaColaCo touts its success at reducing plastic the reality is far from perfect. Many of these drinks are being poured into reusable cups from single use plastic bottles defeating the purpose of reuse in reducing plastic waste.  From a top global plastic polluter and major sports sponsor like theCocaColaCo much more is needed to address the plastic crisis. Despite the flaws the inclusion of reuse at Paris 2024 remains a beacon of hope for the oceans. Reuse done right CAN have a major impact on the environment and there is a growing trend for large events like this to use reusable packaging.

Bottom trawling is a highly destructive fishing practice where huge nets are dragged for miles along the seafloor bulldozing everything in their path. In December 2010 the Belize government banned trawling in the country s waters to protect its marine ecosystems and wildlife. Oceana_bze collaborated with the Prime Minister s administration at the time to help make this ban possible. This milestone stands as a testament to Belize s commitment to protecting marine ecosystems. However bottom trawling continues to threaten oceans globally.

At least two other vessels have also sunk since then causing further oil pollution.It is estimated that the oil spill impacts 50% of Manila Bay with the oil pollution reaching Cavite Bulacan and Bataan. The spill can smother suffocate and kill important mangroves coral reefs and seagrass beds here which are essential for the breeding and feeding of numerous marine species in Manila Bay. We know what s at stake here: jobs food exports and even lives  said Oceana_phs Gloria Ramos.  Even after the oil pollution is cleaned up seafood may be contaminated for years.

Plasticosis as its been named is scarring in the stomach caused by injuries from ingesting plastic. This scarring which was found in a study on shearwater fledglings makes it harder for the birds to digest their food weakening them and putting them at risk of illness and injury. Right now Plasticosis has only been seen in seabirds but we know that plastic is everywhere   including in the food that we ourselves are eating.

This summer three critically endangered whales have been spotted tangled in fishing gear along Canada s coast and only one has been successfully disentangled by responders. Each whale was dragging ropes in its mouth and some also had lines wrapped around their bodies and flippers. When whales get lines trapped in their mouth it can seriously impact their ability to feed and dive which can be life-threatening. North Atlantic right whales migrate from the warm waters off Florida and Georgia traveling along the East Coast of North America to feed in Canadian waters. Along their journey they face numerous threats including entanglement in fishing gear and the danger of being struck by speeding ships. With only around 356 of these whales left alive we are running out of time to pass essential protections to save the North Atlantic right whale from extinction.

Swimming in sync makes it harder for predators to focus on a single fish reducing the chances of an attack. By sticking together they create a confusing ever-shifting mass that keeps them safer. 2  To save energy.Much like migrating birds fish move in unison to travel more efficiently. When swimming together the hydrodynamics of the fish school can allow them to swim using less energy than if they were swimming on their own. 3  To feed.More eyes mean a better chance of spotting food!

But more and more albatrosses are eating something else instead   plastic. And this can be deadly. Digesting sharp bits of plastic can cause internal cuts leading to bleeding and infection and it can also block the bird s digestive system leading to starvation. And it s going to keep happening to seabirds around the world if we keep flooding our oceans with unnecessary single-use plastic.

But right now that s not an option. From November 1st to April 30th lobster fishing is strictly off-limits a crucial pause that allows populations to recover after years of overfishing. And as of February 1st even selling lobster in Brazil is illegal. Why? Because beneath the waves something crucial is happening: lobsters are reproducing.   Without this seasonal break the future of lobster (and the thousands of families who rely on it for their livelihood) would be in jeopardy. Oceana s 2019 stock assessment of red lobsters highlighted the urgency of this issue mobilizing artisanal fishers industry leaders and allies to support catch limits. Lobster is more than just a delicacy it s a lifeline for over 15000 families in Brazil.

Even as a child growing up among 13 brothers and sisters in the northeast coast of Brazil Sidneia never got seasick when she went fishing.  I wake up and look at the sea and the sea gives me a strength that I have never found anywhere else  she says.  Come rain or shine fishing is where I make my living and what makes me happy.  However lobster fishing Sidneia s main source of livelihood has faced challenges. A 2019 assessment by Oceana revealed that the red lobstery fishery was on the verge of collapse. Oceana s analysis and campaigning helped to mobilize artisanal fishers fishing industries and other allies to support implementing catch limits which would help recover the lobster populations and support local fishing communities. These science-based catch limits were implemented earlier this year for the 2024 season a major win for our oceans and for fishers like Sidneia!

These pre-production pellets also called nurdles are frequently spilled during production and transportation and end up in our oceans and waterways. And once they re there they are very difficult to clean up due to their small size. The U.S. needs more tools to keep these plastic pellets from entering our oceans!

Its a tangled story of industrial fishing local livelihoods and climate change.  In Ghana small-scale fishing communities with deep connections to the sea struggle to catch the fish they need compared to industrial vessels.   In Senegal an overcrowded fishing industry combined with the impacts of climate change is both harming fish populations and sending ripples through local economies.   In Malaysia even in one of the countrys oldest fishing villages there are less fish to go around.Any efforts to recover fisheries must prioritize equity. Thats why Oceana is preparing to launch new campaigns to empower the people who rely the most on fish to develop solutions that work for them.

Posts_oceana_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_f49c_CLEANED_309.jpeg,From the brink of extinction: The brown pelican s comeback Once nearly wiped out by the feather trade then poisoned by pesticides the brown pelican is the original success story of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). In the late 1800s these iconic coastal birds were hunted relentlessly for their feathers prized in high fashion. Then in the 1950s they faced a new threat: DDT. This toxic pesticide made its way up the food chain causing pelican eggshells to thin and break before chicks could hatch. Their numbers plummeted. Listed as endangered in 1970 under the Endangered Species Act the brown pelican s turning point came when DDT was banned in the United States in 1972 and with habitat protection thanks to the ESA. As DDT contamination levels dropped their populations rebounded. By 2009 they were fully removed from the Endangered Species List. Today brown pelicans soar along North America s coasts a powerful reminder that the Endangered Species Act works. But now following proposed cuts to NOAA s ability to defend threatened wildlife this critical law is also under attack.   Join us in defending the Endangered Species Act because every species deserves the same chance at survival that the brown pelican had!

His journey into artisanal fishing began at the age of 8 inspired by stories from seasoned fishermen. Among them the tale of the Jangada de S o Pedro a daring voyage in 1941 to demand labor rights from the President of Brazil ignited his lifelong passion for advocacy. Now Beto is at the forefront of modern struggles fighting for fair fishing policies and the preservation of traditional fishing communities. Among what he works towards is a new Fishing Law that will benefit both small-scale fishers and our oceans. With support from OceanaBrasil a bill that would modernize the current Fishing Law was just filed in Brazil s Senate. This bill was drafted with input fishers and shellfish gatherers from traditional communities and is a promising step forward for responsibly managed fisheries and the health of our oceans!  We need to put forward our point of view on sustainability and environmental preservation in order to improve fishing in general says Beto.

Since the 1950 s red spiny lobster and green lobster populations in Brazil have been in steep decline. The potential collapse of this fishery would not only impact these marine species and our oceans but also local artisanal fishers who depend on this activity for their food and livelihood.  For years fishers scientific community industry stakeholders and nonprofit organizations like Oceanabrasil have been working together to try and address this issue. Now through scientific studies stock assessments and coordination with fisherfolk we have helped convince the government to finally act towards a sustainable lobster fishery!
