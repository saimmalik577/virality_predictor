Global biodiversity is collapsing - but its not just a threat to wildlife - its a fundamental threat to HUMANITY. A major reason for wildlife loss is habitat destruction and problematic land use by humans. An astronomical amount of land is dedicated to cows (and feeding cows) which feed a small population with big appetites. Huge swaths of suburban and rural land are dedicated to grass lawns that provide nothing to the ecosystem and require toxic chemicals to maintain. All that land was once habitat. Biodiversity is essential to life on earth. We must change the way we use our land in order to bring wildlife back from the brink. We need to make a massive switch to more plant-based diets wherever possible plant native and support habitat restoration! The UN Biodiversity #COP16 currently taking place in Cali Colombia is a critical opportunity to change course on a more global scale and make the radical systemic changes that our planet desperately needs.

This situation is adding endless suffering to the millions of displaced people in Gaza and adds to the nightmare of dozens of hostages still detained by Hamas and their families. Over the past 15 months the relentless violence has claimed tens of thousands of innocent lives   mostly women and children   and pushed Gaza s infrastructure to collapse. The blockade of essential resources including food water medicine and fuel has left civilians facing starvation disease and worsening suffering. Greenpeace repeats its call for: O An immediate comprehensive and permanent ceasefire to prevent further loss O The unconditional release of all hostages O The urgent and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza O The unconditional release of all illegally detained civilians O A global embargo on arms sales and transfers that fuel further war crimes O The end of the illegal occupation of Palestine in line with international law International law must be upheld and all parties must return to negotiations that build a just and lasting peace. Greenpeace reiterates its call for a future in which Palestinians and Israelis can live side by side in peace in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions and human rights law. #CeasefireNow,greenpeace condemns the israeli governments renewal of the attacks on gaza and the end of the ceasefire this situation is adding endless suffering to the millions of displaced people in gaza and adds to the nightmare of dozens of hostages still detained by hamas and their families over the past 15 months the relentless violence has claimed tens of thousands of innocent lives mostly women and children and pushed gaza s infrastructure to collapse the blockade of essential resources including food water medicine and fuel has left civilians facing starvation disease and worsening suffering greenpeace repeats its call for o an immediate comprehensive and permanent ceasefire to prevent further loss o the unconditional release of all hostages o the urgent and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to the people of gaza o the unconditional release of all illegally detained civilians o a global embargo on arms sales and transfers that fuel further war crimes o the end of the illegal occupation of palestine in line with international law international law must be upheld and all parties must return to negotiations that build a just and lasting peace greenpeace reiterates its call for a future in which palestinians and israelis can live side by side in peace in accordance with un security council resolutions and human rights law #ceasefirenow

This strategy including funding think tanks to cast doubt on climate science has delayed global efforts to combat global warming.Equinor was reportedly fined NOK 50 million in 2005 for price manipulation in Sweden. Total was fined EUR 500000 in France in 2018 for paying bribes to secure a major gas contract in Iran in 1997.BP s Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 spilled millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico causing extensive damage to livelihoods marine life and habitats. In 2004 BP promoted the term  carbon footprint  to shift blame for global heating onto individuals deflecting attention from big oil corporations.In the 1960s Texaco (now Chevron) dumped billions of gallons of toxic wastewater into rivers polluting groundwater and farmland. According to Amazonwatch Chevron disregarded environmental regulations earning an extra US$5 billion over 20 years. In 2016 Indigenous communities and farmers won a court judgement against Chevron but the company refused to pay.Since Shell arrived in 1958 Nigeria s Ogoniland once fertile suffered from toxic spills. Ken Saro-Wiwa led peaceful resistance against Shell protesting its exploitation of Ogoniland. Under Saro-Wiwa s leadership locals challenged Shell and Nigeria s military regime leading to violent crackdowns. Ken Saro-Wiwa and 8 colleagues were wrongfully convicted and executed by the Nigerian government on November 10 1995.Big oil s contribution to climate change has worsened extreme weather disasters causing significant financial and social costs for affected communities.

Posts_greenpeace_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_1ce8 2_CLEANED_124.jpeg,Here are some facts about the Climate Justice Delivery Service:  The service was established in 2024 to deliver debris from extreme weather events to the doorsteps of oil corporations.   Destroyed items donated by survivors of extreme weather events such as floods wildfires and storms are collected and sent to big oil and gas corporations to highlight how their operations are destroying lives and communities. Extreme weather events including typhoons and floods are becoming more frequent and more severe  due to climate change caused by the burning of oil and gas. Homes are destroyed lives are claimed and people are forced to move.  Debris including items like damaged children s toys and furniture have been gathered with extreme weather survivors in countries like Brazil the Philippines and South Africa. The collected debris presents the damage caused by global warming.  Fossil fuels drilled by major oil companies such as Shell BP and Exxon are releasing greenhouse gases that heat the planet. To keep global warming below 1.5 C the use of oil and gas must be stopped. This includes halting all new fossil fuel projects and transitioning to renewable energy like wind and solar. A demand is being made by Greenpeace for oil and gas companies to stop drilling switch to clean energy and take responsibility by paying for the damage caused by global warming. The goal is to protect the planet for future generations. As more and more people are standing against Big Oil the industry gets desperate. It is now trying to use lawsuits to continue with its toxic business as usual. Corporations like Shell ENI TotalEnergies and energytransferlp have taken Greenpeace organisations to court. Using lawsuits against activists organisations and indigenous leaders Big Oil is trying to silence those standing to protect the earth.  Big Oils desperation shows we re making an impact.

The ongoing bombing of Lebanon by Israel and its continued destruction and killing in Gaza and the West Bank must end. With tens of thousands killed and millions of people displaced in the region in the past year alone this horror must stop.  World powers must go beyond words to prevent further bloodshed. We continue to add our voice calling for an immediate comprehensive and permanent ceasefire throughout the Middle East! We call upon the Israeli government not to repeat its actions in Gaza in Lebanon.  Greenpeace MENA staff based in Beirut bear witness to the devastation and indiscriminate nature of the bombings that have taken over 2000 lives. They are among the 1.2 million displaced Lebanese people. We repeat our call for a global embargo on all arms sales and transfers that could be used to further increase the toll of war crimes to be answered once the violence subsides. Violence is not the answer it only brings more violence. We further call for the immediate release of all remaining hostages over 100 and all illegally detained civilians. Greenpeace calls for an end to the illegal occupation of Palestine. Greenpeace supports the UNSC Resolution ambition that  Israel and Palestine live side by side in peace within secure and recognised borders consistent with international law and relevant UN resolutions.

Fossil fuels are the biggest contributor to the climate crisis that causes communities to push through devastating extreme weather everywhere.  The fossil fuel industry has been aware of the crisis they cause for decades but have hidden the truth and discredited the scientific evidence.  The economic cost solely from weather and climate events in 2023 was an estimated USD 301 billion (according to insurers Gallagher Re). Now Fossil fuel companies need to pay the price for the damages they ve consciously caused.  People families and communities are paying the price while fossil fuel companies are making record profits out of their suffering. Their profit is our loss. Our governments must protect our families and communities and make oil companies stop drilling and start paying for the damage they ve caused and the just and fair transition we need.

While Eni makes these obscene profits their business - the extraction and combustion of fossil fuels - is driving deadly extreme weather and damage to people s homelands and livelihoods. The hundreds of billions they rake in have been taken from the pockets of individuals and families pushing basic necessities out of reach for many - either directly through skyrocketing energy bills that have been exacerbating the cost of living or indirectly with industry tax breaks and subsidies. Individuals families and small businesses should not have to bear rising energy costs or go without basic needs while oil and gas companies laugh all the way to the bank. Their emissions poison our atmosphere while their waste contaminates the water we drink and the air we breathe. Treating our communities and planet as collateral damage these corporations ignore the consequences of extreme weather while homes are destroyed and livelihoods wiped out. The fossil fuel industry has been aware of this crisis they caused for decades but have hidden the truth and discredited the scientific evidence. The economic cost solely from weather and climate events in 2023 was an estimated $ 301 billion USD* paid by the taxpayer. It s time for justice: governments must make these companies stop drilling for polluting fuels and start paying for the damage they ve caused and the just and fair transition we need.

International Court of Justice Advisory Opinion (ICJAO) is an initiative by the world championed by the youth of the Pacific taking the worlds biggest problem of climate change to the worlds highest court - the International Court of Justice (ICJ).  Now the issue is in court and during the public hearings starting December 2 we will hear states present so that the ICJ can consider all evidence and real impact stories. The court will also hand out an advisory opinion on what states responsibilities are when it comes to addressing climate change in ensuring the protection of the human rights of current and future generations. These voices can t wait. And as their islands sink lands flood and livelihoods continue to be uprooted the #WitnessStand brings their raw stories to light.

Fossil fuels are the biggest contributor to the climate crisis that causes communities to push through devastating extreme weather everywhere.  The fossil fuel industry has been aware of the crisis they cause for decades but have hidden the truth and discredited the scientific evidence. The economic cost solely from weather and climate events in 2023 was an estimated USD 301 billion (According to insurers Gallagher Re). Now Fossil fuel companies need to pay the price for the damages they ve consciously caused.  People families and communities are paying the price while fossil fuel companies are making record profits out of their suffering. Their profit is our loss. Goverments must protect our families and communities and make oil companies stop drilling and start paying for the damage they ve caused and the just and fair transition we need.

Today must become the anchor point for de-escalation and an unconditional comprehensive and permanent ceasefire throughout the Middle East!  After 416 days of violence the humanitarian and environmental devastation is unbearable. The bullets and bombs must also fall silent in Gaza. It is time for a massive and unhindered humanitarian relief effort and peaceful negotiations towards a lasting peace built on safety justice and equal rights for all. International law must be upheld. We call on Hamas to immediately release all hostages. We call for the Israeli Government to immediately end the blockades on the supply of food water medicine and fuel to the people of Gaza and release all illegally detained civilians. Greenpeace calls for a global embargo on all arms sales and transfers that could be used to further increase the toll of war crimes to be answered by both sides once this war and conflict ends. Greenpeace recognises the deep historic roots that need to be discussed and negotiated if a permanent peace is to be established. Greenpeace calls for an end to the illegal occupation of Palestine.

In January an Oslo District Court ruling invalidated the previous approvals of these projects for lack of impact assessments of global climate effects. They also issued orders restraining any new permits for the fields  Since then the Norwegian state has appealed the decisions and ignored the injunctions. Taking ambitious action to address the climate emergency is a duty of states and not some favour to communities. This case is part of a movement where people across the world are holding to account those responsible for the climate and nature crises which affect fundamental human rights.  #ClimateJustice,breaking after a historic win earlier this year greenpeacenorge and naturogungdom are facing the norwegian government in court again in an effort to immediately halt the ongoing development of three illegal oil fields in january an oslo district court ruling invalidated the previous approvals of these projects for lack of impact assessments of global climate effects they also issued orders restraining any new permits for the fields since then the norwegian state has appealed the decisions and ignored the injunctions taking ambitious action to address the climate emergency is a duty of states and not some favour to communities this case is part of a movement where people across the world are holding to account those responsible for the climate and nature crises which affect fundamental human rights #climatejustice

The three companies named in the lawsuit are PT Bumi Mekar Hijau (BMH) PT Bumi Andalas Permai (BAP) and PT Sebangun Bumi Andalas Wood Industries (SBA Wood Industries). The drainage and destruction of peatlands in these areas which subsequently leads to out-of-control forest fires and haze severely exacerbates the climate crisis.

It was a clever trick on their part as they pushed corporate guilt onto us personally while they carried on drilling for fossil fuels!

It was first coined by Bob Hunter during the 1970s Anti-Whaling Campaign where Greenpeace activists set out to photograph the damages caused by commercial whaling in the North Pacific. These photos by Rex Weyler showed the world the devastating deaths of numerous whales done for the sake of profit. This non-violent action greatly influenced the International Whaling Committee to put a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1982 and a total ban in 1985.Source: BBC#whales #ClimateAction #oceans #photography,the concept of mind bombs centers on using powerful stories to change the world rather than actual bombs it was first coined by bob hunter during the 1970s antiwhaling campaign where greenpeace activists set out to photograph the damages caused by commercial whaling in the north pacific these photos by rex weyler showed the world the devastating deaths of numerous whales done for the sake of profit this nonviolent action greatly influenced the international whaling committee to put a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1982 and a total ban in 1985source bbc#whales #climateaction #oceans #photography

A Greenpeace Nordic report released a few months ago revealed that JBS the worlds largest meat producer would rank 5th if put on a list alongside the reportedly biggest methane emitting corporations and rivals the methane emissions reported for major oil companies ExxonMobil and Shell combined. We urgently need to put an end to the overproduction and overconsumption of industrial meat and dairy. We must reject ever-larger factory farms cruel polluting and destructive and push for a massive shift towards more plant-based diets wherever possible. We must also expose and reject the misleading marketing tactics of the industry which does everything it can to slow the decline in meat and dairy consumption and delay this vital transition. A few months ago Greenpeace activists from several countries took action outside the headquarters of major companies in the sector. They were there to remind us that we can and must meaningfully slow climate breakdown within our lifetime by transitioning to a just food system one that moves away from industrial meat and dairy production and promotes plant-based alternatives and call on governments to act urgently to support this transition.

Last November during #INC5 hosted in Busan city we boarded a gas tanker as part of a peaceful protest to send a strong message about global plastic pollution and as a result I along with my fellow activists Al Sam Jens and Captain Hettie have been prohibited from leaving South Korea under the orders of the Minister of Justice. During this time of being unable to leave the country I received the heartbreaking news of my grandmother s passing. Because of this travel restriction I was unable to attend her funeral. This has left me feeling deeply saddened as I am stuck in Korea waiting for the legal proceedings to conclude with no end in sight unable to grieve alongside my family. 2 months later we are still in Korea waiting for the legal process to unfold. So far no specific timeline has been provided by the Korean judiciary it has been just an endless uncertain wait for the 5 of us.

This year heavy rainfall and flooding has come from rainfall that is abnormally long in duration and wide range in terms of the area impacted. In an El Ni o year the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is particularly high. Analysis from China s National Data Center shows that precipitation has been more than 20% higher than normal for the past ten days in most of southern China with some areas experiencing rainfall as high as twice the average. This year the amount of precipitation from April 4 to June 11 broke historical records for rainfall in southern China going back to 1961. The State General Administration of Flood Control initiated Level 4 Emergency Response for flood control in seven provinces including Fujian Guangxi Zhejiang Guizhou Guangdong Hunan and Jiangxi.

Youth activists from around the world are coming together to share workshop and brainstorm ideas for building a safe and just future with wellbeing at the core. We wanted to share some memorable quotes from Day 2 s speakers.  1. Erick National Front for 40 Hours Mexico  We need to be the owners of our present and our future and this is not only for the young people but for all the generations. We need to overcome taboos and prejudices. We need to raise awareness and empower our youth. The young people need to be aware of our society. The young people need to act.

This week five greenpeacenorge activists took peaceful action against Norwegian oil giant Equinor over its partnership with Ithaca Energy on the Rosebank oil field which is contributing to the illegal occupation of Palestine. Ithaca Energy is owned by Delek Group a company blacklisted by the UN for operating in Occupied Palestinian Territory. If Rosebank goes ahead profits from the oil field will contribute to the financing and expansion of illegal Israeli settlements on Palestinian land. The activists occupied the company s offices in Oslo for nine hours supported by a peaceful demo outside. Thousands of people have raised their voice against equinor s contribution to the bloody and illegal occupation. We call on the Norwegian government Equinor s majority-owner to ensure that Equinor respects human rights and international law.  Equinor must end the relationship with Ithaca and cancel Rosebank.

ICYMI: On 30 November Al Ash Jens and Sam boarded a tanker that was about to load toxic plastic chemicals from South Korea s Hyundai Daesan Refinery complex.  As a part of the  Zero Plastic Tour  Rainbow Warrior ship tour in East Asia they were delivering a strong message to cut plastic pollution to the world leaders gathered at the nearby city of Busan for the fifth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (#INC5) to negotiate a UN Global Plastics Treaty. And fast forward almost 2 months later the 4 activists and Rainbow Warrior Captain Hettie are still under an ongoing investigation for the peaceful direct action. With the follow-up negotiation meeting for the Global Plastics Treaty expected to be announced soon we are asking for your help for a quick conclusion of the investigation so our activists - our #INC5Warriors - can be reunited with their loved ones back home.
