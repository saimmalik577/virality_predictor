Posts_greenmatters_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_d3ce_CLEANED_4.jpeg,Being an environmentalist is about so much more than just caring about nature. To truly be an environmentalist   and fight the climate crisis   one must learn about environmental justice and include the movement in their climate activism. And considering the fact that Martin Luther King Jr. was one of the most incredible civil rights activists in history it shouldn t come as a surprise that he used his voice to advocate for environmental justice on multiple occasions. For instance on April 3 1968 one day before his untimely death King spoke at a protest as part of the Memphis sanitation workers  strike. On Feb. 12 of that year 1300 Black men who worked in sanitation for the city joined together to start the strike as they were fed up with working in polluted and dangerous conditions as compared to the working conditions of the citys white sanitation workers as per Potomac Conservancy. The speech King gave to the workers turned out to be the last speech of his life.  The issue is injustice. The issue is the refusal of Memphis to be fair and honest in its dealings with its public servants who happen to be sanitation workers  King told the crowd. He also recognized the importance of intersectional activism even though he passed away 21 years before Kimberl  Crenshaw coined the phrase.  Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere  King famously wrote in  Letter from a Birmingham Jail  in 1963. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly  he added. That is essentially the definition of intersectional activism. And intersectional environmentalism is incredibly important in the fight against climate change. As long as marginalized groups   such as BIPOC low-income communities and people living in poverty in undeveloped countries   are suffering from the climate crisis more than those who live in predominantly white or affluent areas combating the climate crisis will require an intersectional approach. (Media Description: A photo of MLK Jr. alongside his quote Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.),being an environmentalist is about so much more than just caring about nature to truly be an environmentalist and fight the climate crisis one must learn about environmental justice and include the movement in their climate activism and considering the fact that martin luther king jr was one of the most incredible civil rights activists in history it shouldn t come as a surprise that he used his voice to advocate for environmental justice on multiple occasions for instance on april 3 1968 one day before his untimely death king spoke at a protest as part of the memphis sanitation workers strike on feb 12 of that year 1300 black men who worked in sanitation for the city joined together to start the strike as they were fed up with working in polluted and dangerous conditions as compared to the working conditions of the citys white sanitation workers as per potomac conservancy the speech king gave to the workers turned out to be the last speech of his life the issue is injustice the issue is the refusal of memphis to be fair and honest in its dealings with its public servants who happen to be sanitation workers king told the crowd he also recognized the importance of intersectional activism even though he passed away 21 years before kimberl crenshaw coined the phrase injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere king famously wrote in letter from a birmingham jail in 1963 we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly he added that is essentially the definition of intersectional activism and intersectional environmentalism is incredibly important in the fight against climate change as long as marginalized groups such as bipoc lowincome communities and people living in poverty in undeveloped countries are suffering from the climate crisis more than those who live in predominantly white or affluent areas combating the climate crisis will require an intersectional approach media description a photo of mlk jr alongside his quote injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere

Posts_greenmatters_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_d3ce_CLEANED_15.jpeg,For the past few weeks brands have likely inundated you with endless recommendations of what to do for Earth Day from purchasing supposedly eco-friendly products to going to Earth Day events. And while there are certainly sustainable items worth buying and events worth attending we have another suggestion for today s holiday Do nothing.  Don t get in your car. Don t spend any money. Don t get that manicure. Don t mow your lawn. Don t browse Amazon s Earth Day deals. Don t go on that Earth Day-themed booze cruise.  Just do nothing and avoid the mass consumerism. That ll have a much lighter impact on the planet than most activities outside of the house. Instead of shopping the Earth Day sales leave your wallet in your pocket   and maybe even pledge to buy less going forward. Instead of buying eco-friendly-ish products you may not really need venture outside to take part in a local trash cleanup. Instead of giving in to greenwashed marketing tactics join a climate protest that demands the government and corporations stop polluting the Earth. Basically if you re going to do anything on Earth Day do something that *actually* helps the Earth. Ignore all the messaging telling you to be a performative environmentalist and instead be a real one. One who doesn t participate in excess consumerism but instead participates in climate activism. The point of Earth Day is not to celebrate the planet s beauty or to go shopping   it s to take climate action. So this Earth Day remember that you don t need to buy what corporations tell you to buy or do what they tell you to do. You can celebrate planet Earth (on Earth Day and *every day*) by doing less and living more simply   and maybe use all that saved time to get involved with whatever form of activism speaks to you.

It was then that the ban on slavery was actually enforced in the area and more than 250000 enslaved people were finally granted freedom. That happened on June 19 1865 a day that is seen as the unofficial end to slavery in the U.S.  Every year people around the country enjoy time with friends and family every June 19 celebrating a holiday known as Juneteenth   formerly known as Jubilee Day. In 2021 Juneteenth got the federal recognition it deserves when President Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act making Juneteenth a national holiday. However there is still some debate about when to observe the official end of slavery in our country. Some historians believe that we should celebrate collective liberation in December instead of June as it wasn t until December 1865 six months after General Granger arrived in Texas that the 13th Amendment was ratified which made slavery illegal in border states that had not joined the Confederacy (such as Delaware and Kentucky) effectively banning slavery nationwide.

Posts_greenmatters_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_d3ce_CLEANED_26.jpeg,There are many ways that people can reduce their impact on planet Earth from going vegan to pledging not to fly on airplanes. But for a growing number of individuals they believe the best thing to do for the Earth is participate in the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT) which aims to reduce the number of people on Earth. But don t worry it s far less grim than it sounds. VHEMT encourages people not to have children and believes  voluntary human extinction is the humanitarian alternative to human disasters.  Basically it s a part of the antinatalism movement with a focus on the environmental side of things since each human has an impact on the environment and uses countless resources throughout their decades of life on Earth. The way VHEMT sees it because of that reducing the number of humans brought into the world will slow down the overall human extinction reduce the effects of the climate crisis and enrich and prolong the lives of humans who are already alive. VHEMT s website makes it clear that the people who subscribe to this movement should do so with positive attitudes and without shaming people.  We don t carry on about how the human race has shown itself to be a greedy amoral parasite on the once-healthy face of this planet  the website states.  That type of negativity offers no solution to the inexorable horrors which human activity is causing. Similarly the group Stop Having Kids believes that all humans should make the choice to not have kids and instead make more efforts to support  already existing life  always using  respectful means that honor bodily autonomy and individuality. This is obviously a divisive topic and many have criticized these groups and the antinatalism movement overall. Read the full article at the link in our bio.

Posts_greenmatters_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_d3ce_CLEANED_31.jpeg,It s important to view environmentalism as an intersectional issue and one that is interconnected with all other social justice issues. We cannot adequately fight to protect the planet without fighting for the rights of people too   most importantly groups of people who have been marginalized throughout history. June marks Pride Month a month-long commemoration of the 1969 Stonewall Uprising a six-day series of protests by NYC s LGBTQ+ community that many believe launched the gay rights movement. Even though LGBTQ+ rights in the U.S. have advanced immensely since then and even though same-sex marriage is now legal across the country there is still so much to fight for in terms of equal rights and protections for every member of the LGBTQ+ community. So as you wave your rainbow flag during Pride Month this year make sure to take a moment to honor those who risked their lives to fight for equal rights during the Stonewall Riots.

Slide 3: The Stonewall Riots began at around 2 a.m. on June 28 1969 when police officers raided the Stonewall Inn a gay bar in NYC. The raid soon turned into a riot between the police and NYC s LGBTQ+ community which led to a six-day series of protests. Slide 4: Many people see the Stonewall Riots and protests as the event that launched the gay rights movement.

Posts_greenmatters_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_d3ce_CLEANED_32.jpeg,Happy birthday paulmccartney! The living legend turns 82 years old today   and while we are of course fans of his legendary music we are even bigger fans of the ways the former Beatle uses his voice to speak up for animals and the planet. Paul McCartney first ditched meat in the late 1970s for ethical reasons along with his late wife Linda McCartney. Since then he has stuck to a devout vegetarian lifestyle. And for the past 40-plus years he has spoken up about animal rights issues on many occasions and supported a number of animal rights organizations and campaigns.  Notably McCartney narrated the popular short documentary  Glass Walls  in which he encourages viewers to leave meat off their plate and exposes what really goes on behind the closed doors of slaughterhouses. If slaughterhouses had glass walls everyone would be a vegetarian  he has stated time and time again. He has also addressed animal rights and environmental issues in his music. His 1993 protest song  Looking for Changes  calls out the horrors of vivisection and his jingle  Meat Free Monday  promotes the Meat Free Monday initiative which he actually founded with two of his daughters Stella McCartney and Mary McCartney in 2009. And in 2018 he put out the song  Despite Repeated Warnings  which he has stated is an allegory for climate change. People who deny climate change... I just think its the most stupid thing ever McCartney told BBC News shortly after the release of the song. We hope McCartney has a fantastic birthday!

Posts_greenmatters_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_d3ce_CLEANED_58.jpeg,Fun fact: Today is Cow Appreciation Day. Not so fun fact: Cow Appreciation Day was created by Chick-fil-A. The fast food chain has been at the center of many a controversy for its repeated donations to anti-gay groups with its chairman and owner Dan Cathy being vocally anti-LGBTQ+ rights. Plus Chick-fil-A kills about 2 million chickens daily for its chicken and egg products directly funding the environmentally-destructive and cruel animal agriculuture industry. Since 1995 Chick-fil-A has advertised its fast food with the  Eat Mor Chikin  campaign in which cows hold signs bearing that phrase encouraging customers to go to Chick-fil-A to eat chicken and save the cows. However Chick-fil-A has plenty of cow-based products on its menu from beef to cheese. Interestingly Chick-fil-A no longer hosts Cow Appreciation Day which the company founded in 2005   so we re taking the holiday into our own hands this year. But instead of appreciating cows for the meat and milk they provide   as part of one of the most environmentally ruinous industries on Earth   we re simply appreciating cows for being who they are.

Posts_greenmatters_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_d3ce_CLEANED_91.jpeg,Gen Z is shaking up the fashion market like never before. Tiring of the same old fast fashion brands pumping out repetitive designs on cheaply made clothing Gen Zers are turning their backs on mainstream labels. Instead they are seeking out brands that align with their values and identities they want to know that their purchases are making a positive impact.This shift has led to the rise of lean innovative companies that focus on values and authenticity   like our brand Citizen-T which upcycles used T-shirts into new fashion pieces.Citizen-T respects a desire for quality clothing and doesn t see that as a limitation for finding new means of producing those clothes. It s a challenge to halt the prevailing culture of disposable fashion so we start with a simple idea: What if we repurpose the countless tees discarded at events concerts and festivals? These garments are often worn for just a single day before being discarded contributing to the mounting textile waste crisis.Citizen-T is guided by three core principles: sustainability community and creativity. By prioritizing these pillars in our decision-making processes Citizen-T is not only helping others contribute to a more sustainable future but also inviting industries to rethink their approach to fashion production.  The above is excerpted from an opinion piece written for Green Matters by Isaias Hernandez (queerbrownvegan) and Stephanie Dillon (stephaniedillon_art) the sustainability advisor and founder/artist behind Citizen-T respectively.

There are actually a number of reasons why sleeping naked may be a great option for you   and even your relationship. Charlie Howes founder and Events Director of Nude Life a service dedicated to nude drawing classes explained that sleeping in your birthday suit can increase testosterone. Pajamas can restrict air flow whereas sleeping nude means more circulation of air around the genital organs Howes said.  In an interview with Yahoo Sports general practitioner Dr. Sarah Brewer agreed with Howes and noted that overheating at night can be avoided by sleeping naked. When someone is too hot it can mess up their sleep and that can have a negative effect on testosterone production as well. Additionally Both Dr. Brewer and Howes say sleeping nude is better for your skin because it allows this large organ to breathe better and its less likely for things like moisture to get trapped. Plus Howes pointed out that sleeping naked can help you like your partner more as well as like your own body more. The best way to become comfortable with your body is to spend time with it he stated.

The amount of microplastics found in some brains was roughly equivalent to a disposable plastic spoon (7 grams). While microplastics were present in all samples levels were significantly higher in brains from individuals with known dementia diagnoses. The study suggests that a compromised blood-brain barrier in dementia patients might allow more microplastics to enter the brain rather than microplastics directly causing dementia.  While more research is needed to fully understand the impact of microplastics on human health the study highlights the widespread presence of microplastics in the body.

This symbolic act by the current administration coincides with a significant rollback of environmental policies in 2025.  These policy changes focus on deregulation and supporting the fossil fuel industry and include weakening emissions standards for power plants and vehicles rolling back greenhouse gas restrictions and reducing water protections under the Clean Water Act. Key climate regulations have also been dismantled such as efforts to overturn the EPAs endangerment finding and to relax rules on methane emissions. Simultaneously the administration is expediting fossil fuel development through streamlined permitting and increased support for industries like coal oil and gas. These actions all of which have been scientifically studied and proven to harm the environment and expedite the effects of climate change mark a clear departure from previous environmental priorities.

Posts_greenmatters_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_d3ce_CLEANED_139.jpeg,Yes U.S. plastic recycling rates are abysmally low. And yes recycling plastics only gives them a pretty short new lease on life since plastic can only be downcycled at best. But still we should recycle everything that is recyclable   here are a few real reasons why.   More plastic gets recycled than you might think. You ve probably seen more than a few headlines about how only 9 percent of plastic created between the 1950s and 2017 has actually been recycled  and you ve probably heard a few cynical people use that as an excuse for tossing their recyclable waste in the trash can. But think of all the plastic produced each year   it s roughly 300 million tons worldwide. 9 percent of that is a *lot.*   You don t want to give the fossil fuel industry more excuses to drill for oil do you? Well the less plastic we recycle the less raw materials there will be for post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastics to be made and the greater the excuse for the fossil fuel industry to drill for oil to make more new plastic. By placing your plastics in the blue bin you are at least trying to support the companies making products from PCR plastics.  Simply practicing recycling around others can influence them to follow suit. Look we re not saying recycling is the No. 1 thing you can do for the environment but it should at least be the baseline. As silly as it sounds making the effort to recycle can influence people around you to make recycling all recyclable items their baseline too.  Overall if you are sick of low recycling rates support anti-single-plastic legislation. Recycling is not going to get us out of the plastic pollution crisis but it s definitely going to help. Even more important however is getting more regions to pass single-use plastic bans. Look up legislation for your area and contact your local lawmakers urging them to support these bills.

For years ASALH campaigned for the federal government to acknowledge Black History Month. Come 1976 President Gerald Ford finally deemed it a public holiday and every U.S. POTUS since then has recognized it too. A large part of Black History Month is learning about and honoring the incredible Black activists abolitionists and leaders who have shaped history from Jackie Robinson and Satchel Paige to Stevie Wonder and Beyonc .

The holiday kicks off World Vegan Month and encourages people companies and policy makers to learn more about the vegan lifestyle. The Vegan Society describes World Vegan Month as  a time to shine a light on the vegan movement  while Farm Animal Rights Movement (FARM) calls it  a month of compassion and understanding of veganism. There are so many reasons to go vegan or at least incorporate more plant-based choices into your life   and one is the undeniable positive effects a vegan lifestyle has on the environment. A study published in the journal Nature Food in 2023 studied 55504 people with diets ranging from vegans to meat-eaters and compared their diets with data from 38000 farms across 119 countries. Overall the researchers found that even with food being produced in different places and by different methods  the relationship between environmental impact and animal-based food consumption is clear and should prompt the reduction of the latter. In fact the study concluded that eating a plant-based diet produces about 75 percent less emissions land use water pollution and more when compared to meat-heavy diets.

Thats why weve come up with a few sustainable ways to get rid of your exs junk once and for all. Start out by selling or donating your exs clothes. The most responsible way to get rid of your exs tees shoes hats bras socks or underwear is to donate them or to properly recycle them. You can even sell their old stuff on Poshmark or Depop and get a little cash to make up for their mistakes. And if youre thinking of putting your exs electronics in the trash please dont. Tossing your exs old electric toothbrush or cell phone charger in the garbage may make you feel good but it wont leave the planet feeling good in the long run. E-waste is a major problem that results in an influx of landfill trash as well as potentially toxic battery leaks. There are so many places where you can recycle electronics (including your local Best Buy) as well as websites where you can sell used technology such as Back Market.  Although tossing your exs stuff in the trash or in a bonfire may feel empowering it will ultimately leave behind a negative environmental impact. That said taking the few extra steps to properly dispose of their stuff is a good way to go. Follow that up with a bottle of vegan bubbly and chocolate and you have yourself some truly incredible Valentines Day plans.

It ll go nicely with your eco-anxiety! But the good news is there are many ways to fight these negative feelings associated with fear of the climate emergency which are often driven by the media or activists who use climate doomism as a tactic. (While this tactic can be effective some mental health professionals have observed an uptick in anxiety due to climate doomism.) The best way to fight that feeling is to get involved with climate action in whatever way speaks to you most.  On an individual level climate action can be as simple as making eco-conscious lifestyle choices. Individuals can also get involved in climate action by studying topics related to the climate or starting a career that involves advocating for the climate such as a job in climate science or in the environmental nonprofit sector. Climate action also encapsulates climate activism which refers to protesting campaigning or otherwise demonstrating to enact tangible change from leaders. For this you may choose to get involved with an environmental organization attend protests or climate strikes or reach out to government officials industry leaders and corporations demanding change. What do you do to combat climate doomism? Share your ideas in the comments   and maybe getting more involved in climate action will be your 2025 New Years resolution.

Posts_greenmatters_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_d3ce_CLEANED_204.jpeg,A growing community of people are encouraging others to ditch the foot prisons   as put by Yoshua the Barefoot Human Greenfield   and truly connect with the ground. Your foot is the foundation of your body everything works its way up from there. If the root of your body isnt stable if it isnt accounted for how might that affect everything else? Greenfield   a musician author and barefoot influencer   told Green Matters in an interview last year. The more we love on our feet the more we see how much they support the rest of us. While Greenfield advocates for going barefoot   or wearing barefoot shoes   as often as possible board-certified podiatrist Dr. Jodi R. Schoenhaus points to both the positives and negatives of going barefoot. Although it has been around since humans walked upright it keeps getting more and more popular  Dr. Schoenhaus said of barefooting.  For thousands of years even before the invention of shoes people walked barefoot. People believe that walking without the support of shoes is a more natural process. However she also pointed out that  Most people do not have a normal foot type. They either have a high-arched cavus foot or a flat foot that pronates. When we wear a shoe we allow the shoe to support the sole. People who have flat feet or high arch feet can develop problems as they age. Walking barefoot leads to more strain and impact on the muscles and joints causing tendinitis arthritis and deformity  she continued.

But since its founding in 2016 Stone Road has been doing things differently. Located in Nevada City Calif. the farm features just a half an acre s worth of greenhouses on a rural 57-acre area of land meaning the land is 99 percent  wild and untamed. Lex Corwin s farm is also regenerative meaning the farm works to improve the land and soil s health as well as tries  to decrease the amount of outside inputs you need to bring your crop to fruition. This means Stone Road uses solar energy composts its own waste sources all of its water straight from an artesian well and uses living soil to create mini ecosystems that encourage healthy plant growth and naturally keep pests away. The brand also works to make its packaging as  sustainable as possible  Corwin tells Green Matters. Stone Road s boxes are made from cardboard and 99 percent plastic-free and the company is  soon moving to 100 percent plastic-free tins. A brand is a reflection of the person who started it  Corwin says.  Im making a product that I myself use and would use as a consumer. Ultimately a good brand is just like a reflection of the organizations value system.

This phenomenon poses a significant threat as the released carbon dioxide and methane can further accelerate global warming. A recent study analyzed the potential carbon release from thawing permafrost. The research considered different warming scenarios and estimated that under a more severe warming scenario up to 252 gigatons of carbon could be released by 2100. While this represents a substantial amount the study also acknowledges that increased plant growth due to increased nitrogen availability from decomposing organic matter may partially offset these emissions. However the long-term consequences of thawing permafrost including altered ecosystems and the potential for more rapid carbon release remain a significant concern.

According to the UN the rhinoceros is one of the most endangered animals with only about 27000 rhinos currently on Earth. One major cause of their species  decline is habitat loss which is primarily caused by human activities like development of land agriculture and logging. The other major cause is poaching (typically for rhino horns) as per the WWF.

Posts_greenmatters_18_Apr_2024_17_Apr_2025_d3ce_CLEANED_260.jpeg,The next planetary parade will be visible tomorrow June 3 2024. Mercury Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune will comprise this parade of planets which will technically be visible in the northern hemisphere in the early morning. However you shouldnt expect much. According to many news outlets northern hemisphere residents will have amazing views of the planetary alignment. However Forbes reports that many of these reports are grossly exaggerated based on an article by the astronomy app Star Walk which implies that all six planets will be seen at once. As reported by Forbes Star Walk bases the information on what can be seen on its app not in the actual sky. The trouble is there s something it fails to make clear: you ll only actually see two planets   and neither of them will be particularly bright or impressive. Mars and Saturn are the only two planets that may technically be visible to the naked eye but views will be faint. Neptune and Uranus will potentially be visible as well though youll need a large telescope to see them.

If you re ready to get your Christmas tree out of your house please don t throw it in the trash. There are a number of things you can do to ensure your tree goes back to nature rather than sit in a landfill.  First check if your municipality is offering a Christmas tree pickup or drop-off service in January. Many communities will pick up trees right from the curb while many others set drop-off times when you can deposit your tree at specific points. The city will then compost the trees or recycle them into mulch or wood chips helping keep them out of the landfill. The Home Depot also has a Christmas tree recycling program. Check with your local store for this year s policies. The Home Depot also recommends renting a wood chipper from your local store which you can use to turn your tree into wood chips which you can then use around your property or simply compost. You can also check out Earth911 s Recycling Locator   just click on  where to recycle  on Earth911 s homepage and type in  Christmas tree  along with your zip code and the website will alert you to the closest options for recycling your tree. And finally if you have access to outdoor space such as a backyard (or even a nearby forest or hiking trail) you can simply deposit your tree there where animals will enjoy the new habitat. Or break your tree into small pieces and add them to your compost.  Just be sure to never put your Christmas tree in a fireplace or set it on fire in any way as it could start a house fire. That said all of the above only applies to bare Christmas trees that have no ornaments lights or paint on them. If yours was decorated with flocking spray it s sadly destined for the trash. So next year make sure to choose a real tree and keep it paint-free or even better choose a living tree that is still attached to the root ball meaning you can plant it outside after the holiday.,christmas has come and gone and that tree in your living room has seen better days if you re ready to get your christmas tree out of your house please don t throw it in the trash there are a number of things you can do to ensure your tree goes back to nature rather than sit in a landfill first check if your municipality is offering a christmas tree pickup or dropoff service in january many communities will pick up trees right from the curb while many others set dropoff times when you can deposit your tree at specific points the city will then compost the trees or recycle them into mulch or wood chips helping keep them out of the landfill the home depot also has a christmas tree recycling program check with your local store for this year s policies the home depot also recommends renting a wood chipper from your local store which you can use to turn your tree into wood chips which you can then use around your property or simply compost you can also check out earth911 s recycling locator just click on where to recycle on earth911 s homepage and type in christmas tree along with your zip code and the website will alert you to the closest options for recycling your tree and finally if you have access to outdoor space such as a backyard or even a nearby forest or hiking trail you can simply deposit your tree there where animals will enjoy the new habitat or break your tree into small pieces and add them to your compost just be sure to never put your christmas tree in a fireplace or set it on fire in any way as it could start a house fire that said all of the above only applies to bare christmas trees that have no ornaments lights or paint on them if yours was decorated with flocking spray it s sadly destined for the trash so next year make sure to choose a real tree and keep it paintfree or even better choose a living tree that is still attached to the root ball meaning you can plant it outside after the holiday

The researchers believe that the hydrated iron oxide mineral ferrihydrite is responsible.  The fact that a hydrated mineral is apparently so omnipresent on Mars implies that Mars once had water before evolving into the dry arid environment the planet is known for today.

I became a vegetarian that day he told the news agency. And in recent years he has grown vocal about making the world a better place. On the opening track of his 2021 EP  Change the World  he sings:  Lets change the world / Raise up your voices and sing it out / Lets change the world / Music and love is what its all about. He echoed that message in 2022 when he partnered with WaterAid s Climate Fight campaign.  We all share one world and we need to come together to protect it and each other as we face the threat of climate change  Starr said in honor of the campaign s launch as per Yahoo! News.

Even though the green Chicago River looks undeniably toxic to say the least it doesnt seem as though the dye is actually doing anything to harm the environment. According to The Independent its been dyed for years by the Chicago Plumbers Union Local 130.  Initially the dye which used to be made of fluorescein was used to test leaky pipes and it would last for a week. But environmentalists have since identified environmental issues behind using oil-based fluorescein in a natural body of water so in 1966 the plumbers union transitioned to using whats used currently: a low-impact orange powder thats made from vegetables. The mixture which they call Leprechaun Dust turns green as soon as it hits the water and lasts for 48 hours. The dye used is a food grade dye also used in medicine as the colorant for antifreeze and as a tracer dye. The Illinois EPA found that at the concentration used in the Chicago River it is completely non-toxic reads a statement from the EPA as per NiCHE Canada. An EPA toxicologist also reviewed the dye and deemed it safe for the river. Others feel differently though. NiCHE Canadas Isaac Green says it has a negative undertone. Dyeing the river continues and perpetuates the notion that we can modify rivers to suit our tastes with no regard to the consequences. Thus even if the dye itself isn t ecologically harmful the process of dying the river can sustain harmful ecological ideas Green wrote. ... the dye allows people to believe the river isn t natural therefore justifying its treatment as a sewer.

It ll go nicely with your eco-anxiety! But the good news is there are many ways to fight these negative feelings associated with fear of the climate emergency which are often driven by the media or activists who use climate doomism as a tactic. (While this tactic can be effective some mental health professionals have observed an uptick in anxiety due to climate doomism.) The best way to fight that feeling is to get involved with climate action in whatever way speaks to you most.  On an individual level climate action can be as simple as making eco-conscious lifestyle choices. Individuals can also get involved in climate action by studying topics related to the climate or starting a career that involves advocating for the climate such as a job in climate science or in the environmental nonprofit sector. Climate action also encapsulates climate activism which refers to protesting campaigning or otherwise demonstrating to enact tangible change from leaders. For this you may choose to get involved with an environmental organization attend protests or climate strikes or reach out to government officials industry leaders and corporations demanding change. What do you do to combat climate doomism? Share your ideas in the comments! (Media Description: An image featuring a melting glacier surrounded by rocky terrain.

This expansion encompassing sources like wind solar geothermal and hydroelectric power outpaced the growth of traditional fossil fuel-based energy. The data primarily from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) highlighted that while a record amount of renewable capacity was added the overall growth rate is still slightly behind the required pace to meet global 2030 renewable energy targets. Despite the positive trend the distribution of renewable energy adoption remains uneven. Furthermore the future of renewable energy growth faces potential challenges including possible policy shifts favoring fossil fuels and ongoing concerns about energy security. Solar and wind energy were the largest contributors to the growth. The report shows that while the world is making progress there are still challenges to overcome.

Today is Thanksgiving and the 402nd anniversary of the supposed first Thanksgiving   and while enjoying a yummy meal with friends and family can definitely be a good thing it s important to acknowledge the problematic history of the holiday. Thanksgiving is rooted in a historical fallacy  Matika Wilbur (matikawilbur) a member of the Tulalip and Swinomish tribes told todayparents in 2020. The main Pilgrim narrative coincides with colonization that was inherently oppressive and brutal. As smithsonianmagazine puts it the watered-down version of the Thanksgiving story frames the Pilgrims as the protagonists. In actuality they were the antagonists. For thousands of years the Wampanoag lived peacefully in the Americas. But in the 1610s English colonizers (including the Pilgrims) arrived   they brought disease to the Americas they kidnapped Native Americans and sold them to Europeans as slaves and they stole Native American land and settled on it. As Blackfeet Tribe member Gyasi Ross (bigindiangyasi) explained for MSNBC the narrative often suggests that the Pilgrims came to the Americas in good faith that they happily hosted the Wampanoag at Thanksgiving and that the Pilgrims cooked turkey and sweet potato pie for their guests. However this is part of the mythology of white America according to Ross. [The Pilgrims] could not [bring food to Thanksgiving]. They were broke Ross said. They were begging. They brought nothing of value. But they got fed [by the Wampanoag]. Without the Wampanoag the Pilgrims would not have survived in America.

And ahead of tonight s Earth Day premiere we re sharing an exclusive clip from the film with our audience.In 1865 Freedom Hill was established on boggy land along North Carolinas Tar River land once deemed uninhabitable by white Americans. After the Civil War formerly enslaved Africans saw an opportunity to prosper settling and nicknaming the land Freedom Hill making it the first town in the United States chartered by formerly enslaved Africans according to Cox. It was later renamed Princeville N.C.Because Princeville sits along a floodplain centuries of flooding erode the land quite literally erasing it. Plus the Tar Rivers waters have been rising since the early 20th century.But these destructive events in Princeville are man-made disasters and not natural disasters Cox tells Green Matters exclusively.
