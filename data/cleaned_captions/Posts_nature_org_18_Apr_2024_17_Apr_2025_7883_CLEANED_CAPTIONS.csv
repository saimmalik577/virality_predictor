Scientists at TNC have spent 10 years identifying climate-resilient landscapes across the U.S. to help animals adapt. Here are a few ways climate change is affecting winter wildlife:  Canada lynx built for snowy terrain with their big furry paws struggle to adapt as winters warm retreating to higher elevations and becoming more isolated.  Ermine and snowshoe hares change color with the seasons but shorter winters mean their white coats stand out in a snowless landscape making them easy prey.  Hibernation is crucial for many animals but unpredictable temperatures can cause them to wake up too early leaving them unprepared for sudden cold periods.Efforts are being made to maintain connections between habitat areas ensuring wildlife can find suitable conditions even as the climate shifts.

They are the silent heroes working to keep this planet healthy. As part of our commitment we re championing reforestation efforts to combat the connected crises of climate change and biodiversity loss.As if these climate heroes couldn t get any better here are some interesting facts: In big storms a mature tree can soak up and store 50 to 100 gallons of rainwater reducing flooding. A walk in a forest will measurably lower a person s stress hormones blood pressure and heart rate.  A single large tree can pump over a ton of water vapor into the sky in a day. 200 large trees can create a raincloud.  Over the course of 50 years a single tree can provide $62000 worth of air pollution control.  An acre of trees provides enough oxygen for 18 people to breathe each year.Feeling inspired to plant some trees this #arborday? Click the link in our bio to join us in planting a billion trees.  :1.

Some species are endemic while others have diversified into a multitude of forms each playing a crucial role in their ecosystems. Here are just a few examples of the amazing animals in Africa:African Bush Elephant: These giants roam the savannas and deserts of sub-Saharan Africa and can live up to 70 years- longer than any other mammal except humans.Lemur: Native to Madagascar lemurs are vital to the islands ecosystem aiding in plant pollination and seed dispersal. Unfortunately nearly all lemur species are endangered with about one-third critically endangered.Blue Whale: Once nearly extinct due to commercial whaling blue whales now have a population of 5000-15000. Recently theyve been spotted around the Seychelles a former whaling hotspot thanks to increased marine protection efforts.These fascinating creatures are just a glimpse of Africas rich wildlife.

If youre a farmer dealing with feral pigs panthers are an unlikely ally.Invasive hogs are best managed naturally by their predators but with only around 200 panthers left in Florida due to rapid development and road expansion their numbers are dwindling. The U.S. Farm Bill was a win-win for farmer George Winslow helping him place a conservation easement on his citrus farm. This not only protects his land from future development but also creates a wildlife corridor linking panther breeding grounds and habitats.Florida panthers rely on this network of protected lands to hunt and breed using these areas as safe pathways and sources of food and water.

Expecting to see a jumping fish you instead spot a furry creature paddling along. As it gets closer to shore you wonder is it a beaver? An otter? Or something else? These animals can be tricky to tell apart but there are a few characteristics that can help you identify some common freshwater mammals:American Mink: These weasel-like creatures have a slender streamlined body and a furred tail. They are active predators and can often be seen running along stream banks while hunting.River Otters: These curious critters are considerably larger than minks reaching several feet in length. They have roundish almost dog-like faces and longer flat tails.Beavers: Look for their flattened large paddle-shaped tail. Beavers have a round build and are quite large with adult males weighing 50 pounds or more!Muskrats: Often mistaken for small beavers muskrats have a rat like furless tail. They weigh 3 to 4 pounds at most and have a round fur ball build. : 1. Tony Norton/TNC Photo Contest 20192. Mark Conlin 3. Kent Mason4.

Though cute bunnies and teeny mice may not seem that exciting they often lead to larger species. Here are 4 tips for viewing unique wildlife interactions: 1  Look for abundance. If there s lots of prey around guess where the predators will be? Exactly. Find a vole-filled field or frog-rich pond on your next hike. 2  Follow the birds. Find a flock of birds and watch their behavior carefully. You should also listen to their audio cues. 3  What s the fuss about? Chirping squirrels screeching birds   if prey is making a lot of noise that could mean a predator is in the area. 4  Observe body language. Pay attention to the movements of the prey. If they look like they re on high alert stick around to find the culprit. Being present in nature is your best bet to witness some nature-documentary-esque animal behavior. Don t forget to be aware of your surroundings and respect the space of wildlife big and small.  : Bear: David Swindler/TNC Photo Contest 2022 Fox:  Marci Lanois/TNC Photo Contest 2022 Mountain Lion: Robert McRae/TNC Photo Contest 2019 Owl: Christine Haines/TNC Photo Contest 2021 Eagle and fox: Zifeng Chen/TNC Photo Contest 2022,for nature lovers who want to see scenes straight out of a documentary in real life here s an idea to try follow the prey though cute bunnies and teeny mice may not seem that exciting they often lead to larger species here are 4 tips for viewing unique wildlife interactions 1 look for abundance if there s lots of prey around guess where the predators will be exactly find a volefilled field or frogrich pond on your next hike 2 follow the birds find a flock of birds and watch their behavior carefully you should also listen to their audio cues 3 what s the fuss about chirping squirrels screeching birds if prey is making a lot of noise that could mean a predator is in the area 4 observe body language pay attention to the movements of the prey if they look like they re on high alert stick around to find the culprit being present in nature is your best bet to witness some naturedocumentaryesque animal behavior don t forget to be aware of your surroundings and respect the space of wildlife big and small bear david swindlertnc photo contest 2022 fox marci lanoistnc photo contest 2022 mountain lion robert mcraetnc photo contest 2019 owl christine hainestnc photo contest 2021 eagle and fox zifeng chentnc photo contest 2022

Since the 1970s the ethereal and species-rich kelp forests of Tasmania and Southern Australia have been in serious decline due to climate change and habitat degradation only about 5% of historical canopy coverage remains in Tasmania.   But a new collaboration between The Nature Conservancy Google and other partners is using AI-generated maps to reveal the current state of the giant kelp canopy indicate where to collect samples for a biobank that will preserve the species  genetic diversity and direct restoration efforts.     Meanwhile biologists are growing giant kelp in labs and last year seeded the fastgrowing species at 16 study sites in preparation to ramp up outplanting efforts. Help for kelp is on the way!

Now 14600 acres including the pond and forest will be protected in perpetuity through an agreement by The Nature Conservancy and New York State. One of the conservation easements establishes a freshwater research preserve to study the pond among the most climate-resilient trout lakes in the Northeast due to its depth and the surrounding forest. It also ensures Indigenous Nations can access their ancestral lands for ceremonies and gathering.Traditional knowledge of the human-nature connection long predates the Philosophers  conversations says TNC s Adirondack Director Peg Olsen.

The fins were dried and sold to make soup. Despite a tenfold increase in protective regulations since 2000 a global analysis of shark mortality from fishing finds that these efforts have not been enough to curb the exploitation of sharks. The unsustainable fishing of sharks is a global problem of staggering proportions  says Darcy Bradley a lead ocean scientist for The Nature Conservancy in California. She co-authored the study published in Science which finds shark mortality increased from 76 million to 80 million sharks per year between 2012 and 2019 with more than 30% of these catches involving species threatened with extinction.  Most regulations were designed to prevent shark finning specifically not shark fi shing so they failed to reduce mortality overall  says Bradley.But there is some positive news: The study shows that in countries with shark sanctuaries like the Bahamas and the Maldives shark-fi shing mortality is relatively low likely allowing shark populations to recover and thrive.    thomaspeschak,tip offa shiver of blacktip reef sharks laze in an indian ocean lagoonstarting in the late 1900s countries around the world began prohibiting shark finning the practice of catching sharks slicing off their fins and dumping their often still living bodies back in the water the fins were dried and sold to make soup despite a tenfold increase in protective regulations since 2000 a global analysis of shark mortality from fishing finds that these efforts have not been enough to curb the exploitation of sharks the unsustainable fishing of sharks is a global problem of staggering proportions says darcy bradley a lead ocean scientist for the nature conservancy in california she coauthored the study published in science which finds shark mortality increased from 76 million to 80 million sharks per year between 2012 and 2019 with more than 30 of these catches involving species threatened with extinction most regulations were designed to prevent shark finning specifically not shark fi shing so they failed to reduce mortality overall says bradleybut there is some positive news the study shows that in countries with shark sanctuaries like the bahamas and the maldives sharkfi shing mortality is relatively low likely allowing shark populations to recover and thrive thomaspeschak

Yet it is imperiled. Globally grasslands are the world s most threatened and least-protected ecosystems  says Galen Guerrero-Murphy director of the Southern High Plains Initiative for TNC. But a regional partnership known as the Southern High Plains Initiative aims to protect large connected landscapes to allow species to move and adapt to climate change while also preserving a way of life for local communities. Since 2020 the initiative has also helped conserve land by providing incentives to help ranchers and farmers invest in sustainable and regenerative practices. Those efforts are making an impact in the Southern High Plains and driving innovations that can be exported to grasslands everywhere.

Though it is an amazing experience to see one of these beauties in real life it s important to learn safety tips.The Greater Yellowstone grizzly bear population has increased from less than 200 in the 1980s to more than 1000 today. As the species spreads out the odds of seeing one increases. So it s important we learn to share our planet! Here are some tips to keep both yourself and these creatures safe:    Store food and garbage in bear-resistant bins. Don t tempt them with food they shouldn t eat and save yourself a bear encounter!    Carry bear spray. Be loud to warn bears you re on the path. Have bear spray in hand in case of a face-to-face encounter.    Look for a certified seal on your cooler. Basically a captive grizzly tried to get through the cooler couldn t and now it s certified!  Respect their space. Seeing a bear in real life is super cool but keep a safe distance for both their safety and yours.

Conservation tends to focus on areas of species richness. But safeguarding one biodiverse hot spot might not be enough to save a species across its range says study lead author Nicholas Wolff TNC s global director of climate science.Many locations with critical populations of just a small number of species are vitally important for avoiding extinctions. Rather than prioritize land protection based solely on biological diversity as has historically been the case researchers modeled what would happen if conservationists also incorporated population-level information such as the growth rates and habitat needs of every individual population of a species. Results showed that only 8% of the areas upon which at-risk mammals depend most for their survival fall within strict protection categories. The key takeaway is that we can t only go to the most species-rich places. We have to think about how best to protect each population  says Wolff noting that this approach could reduce species extinction risk twice as efficiently as current methods.  We ll need to move quickly to halt extinctions but we finally have the tools.  Kirsten Weir :1. Red Panda: Dr. Axel Gebauer/naturepl.com2. African Wild Dog: Laurent Geslin/naturepl.com3.

We congratulate the Government of Indonesia and the U.S. Treasury Department for closing yet another bilateral TFCCA deal today which is the first time that this specific instrument is being used to protect marine habitat and corals.  - Jennifer Morris CEO The Nature ConservancyOn the 25th anniversary of the Tropical Forest and Coral Reef Conservation Act we re thrilled to announce a new TFCCA debt-for-nature swap with Indonesia. Through this agreement $35 million will go towards supporting local projects that are protecting and restoring the country s coral reef habitats and helping to create sustainable livelihoods for communities that rely on these marine ecosystems.Indonesia is home to a whopping 16% of the world s coral reefs and many of these habitats are facing huge threats.

The cookie-cutter shark equipped with razor-sharp teeth chisels off chunks of flesh leaving craters on their prey. From other seals to whales these sharks don t let their small size stop them from snacking.   Sea cucumbers are vital ecosystem engineers who crawl across the seafloor vacuuming up sand and pooping it back out again. Their feeding activity helps distribute nutrients and remove excess organic matter from the water.

The data is used to monitor population dynamics and prevent human wildlife conflict in community areas.In 2022 TNC teamed up with Panthera to expand their collaring efforts. Across the Kafue ecosystem TNC is working to halt poaching prevent habitat loss as well as empower communities to protect wildlife and effectively manage their lands. By keeping tabs on the health of carnivore populations conservationists can learn how the animals respond to different protection efforts across the landscape. And data suggest that they are proving successful: Recently one collared cheetah safely traveled about 700 miles over eight months.

That s why TNC is partnering with the non-profit Colorado Agrivoltaic Learning Center to learn how solar farming and traditional farming can coexist. The learning center is based at JacksSolarGarden near Longmont Colorado where farmers grow crops and researchers study the details of how growing conditions vary around solar arrays.
