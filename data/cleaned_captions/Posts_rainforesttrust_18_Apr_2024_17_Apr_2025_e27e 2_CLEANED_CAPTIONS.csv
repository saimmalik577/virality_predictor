The Critically Endangered Helmeted Hornbill is the target of massive-scale poaching for the  ivory  in the brightly colored bony casque adorning its head. The bird is being hunted to extinction across its range in Southeast Asia and without protection its very existence is in jeopardy. An expanse of rainforest in the Indonesian territory of Borneo stands as a crucial stronghold for the Helmeted Hornbill and seven other hornbill species. The area is renowned for its largely pristine landscape of lowland rainforest heath forests and peat swamps.

Tracking data revealed a dramatic recovery of the lion population and a healthy population of chimpanzees in the area protected by Rainforest Trust s conservation work. In Chinko where the forest meets the savanna pastoralist herders convert wilderness habitat to cattle pasture and poaching driven by poverty and civil unrest is rampant.  Rainforest Trust is supporting land management that guides herders to areas outside the conservation area where they can graze their cattle. By the end of 2024 we had expanded the zone that limits human-wildlife interaction to over 7850 square miles. The track count from 2024 indicates the lion population has exceeded 2012 levels the highest on record before human encroachment into the area. Our partner africanparksnetwork sent brand new camera-trap photos of lions in the Yassa Lake area where the cameras also documented numerous other African mammals. . . .

Not only did we exceed our goal by adding 2% more protected acreage but during the course of the project the Laos  Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry proposed upgrading the entire area to a National Park.  The park is now nearly 500000 acres in size giving critically endangered species like the Large-antlered Muntjac and Red-shanked Douc Langur a chance at survival.  This project is part of Rainforest Trust s strategy to protect the Annamite Mountains a lush biodiverse treasure spanning the Laos-Vietnam border in Southeast Asia that shelters some of the world s most spectacular threatened wildlife.

This land is a safe haven for threatened wildlife in northern Kenya including 14% of the country s Black Rhino   population and the world s single largest population of Grevy s Zebra. In 2023 the Lewa-Borana landscape reached its capacity for rhinos. As one of the Conservancy s special projects Lewa in collaboration with the Kenya Wildlife Service began plans to translocate rhinos in 2024 to various sanctuaries in other parts of the country a significant step forward in saving this endangered species.  So far Lewa has carried out two successful rhino translocations to nearby conservancies to promote further species recovery. These strategic translocations have relieved pressure on Lewa s carrying capacity and are facilitating the revitalization of these crucial species within their new homes.
